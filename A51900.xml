                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684 when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AS ſuperfluous as <hi>Prefaces</hi> ſeem, yet there is one
thing which makes it in a manner neceſſary to prefix a few Lines to this
<hi>Volume,</hi> in regard there is an Occaſion given by the Objections
ſome Gentlemen have been lately pleaſed to make againſt the Style of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation. Theſe Perſons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a very coſtly
Inquiſitiveneſs, found and procur'd the <hi>Italian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of theſe
<hi>Letters,</hi> and compar'd them with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> pick many
Faults in the latter, which they would fain improve to the leſſening the
Reputation of the <hi>Turkiſh Spy,</hi> or at leaſt to the heightening
their<pb facs="tcp:104896:4"/>own Characters as <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Maſters</hi> of <hi>Languages,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Patentees</hi> of
<hi>Humane Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Firſt Place they ſay, the <hi>Italian</hi>
Tranſlation keeps cloſe to the Original <hi>Arabick;</hi> whereas the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> abounds too much with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliciſms,</hi> which are not
ſufficient to expreſs the <hi>Author</hi>'s Primitive Senſe.</p>
            <p>How Impoſſible a Thing it is, to pleaſe all People in
Undertakings of this Nature! Formerly they were offended that ſo many
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Words were left untranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And that being anſwered in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Fourth
Volume,</hi> they have now form'd New Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of that very Anſwer, to
aſſault us on the contrary Side, and tax us with being too
<hi>Vernacular.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Letters</hi> they have ſent to the
<hi>Bookſeller</hi> on this Account, are not ſubſcrib'd at Length. Yet by
Accident, one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's<pb facs="tcp:104896:4"/>Hand-Writing is known. And tho' we
acknowledge him to be an Ingenious Perſon, and a Man of Learning; yet I
believe he would be unwilling his <hi>Letter</hi> ſhould here be expos'd in
Print (or the <hi>Original</hi> ſhew'd to ſome that know him, and perhaps
may claim an Equal Rank among the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But to come to the purpoſe; I have often heard
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for keeping too cloſe to the
<hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Phraſe, but never any before this, for a Negligence that
is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to retain the Senſe of a <hi>Foreign
Author.</hi> All the World knows, there is a vaſt Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Arabick</hi> and the <hi>Languages</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> and if the
<hi>Italian Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi> was more exact in forming his Words up to a near
Imitation of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Proprieties of Speech, no doubt but
Impartial Men will rather Cenſure it as a Fault, than cry it up for an
Excellency; ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<pb facs="tcp:104896:5"/>ſounds well in any <hi>Language</hi>
which is not deliver'd in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Idiom.</hi> Every thing ought to be
writ in as Familiar a Style as we Diſcourſe; eſpecially <hi>Letters,</hi>
which are but a Proxy-Method of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing at a Diſtance. And he that
Tranſlates out of one <hi>Language</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, ought to aim Chiefly
at this, That he be ſure to retain the <hi>Original</hi> Senſe, and render
it ſmooth and eaſy to the Reader. The Flowers of <hi>Arabia</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> when once Tranſplanted to our barren <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soil,
loſe their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Beauty, till they are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliz'd: What then muſt
we expect from their Weeds? Doubtleſs, there are ſome Peculiarities in all
<hi>Languages;</hi> and to Tranſlate <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> from ſo Remote a
<hi>Tongue,</hi> would ſound as harſh as <hi>French</hi> does in an
<hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Mouth, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it as 'tis writ.</p>
            <p>What I have more to ſay is, that as this <hi>Volume</hi>
contains a <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104896:5"/>of things tranſacted within the
Memory of moſt Men now living; ſo the Two ſucceeding <hi>Tomes</hi> fall
down lower and nearer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Times: Giving an Account of Events
whereof many have been Eye-Witneſſes, and wherein not a few have had a
Perſonal Share ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Way of Action or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Profit or Damage;
which muſt needs afford Delight to thinking Men, ſince there is nothing
more Agreeable to Mortals than to reflect on the former Paſſages of their
Lives according to that of the <hi>Poet:</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>Haec olim meminiſſe juvabit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, for the farther Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Candid Reader, he
may aſſure himſelf, that toward the Concluſion of the Laſt
<hi>Volume,</hi> he will meet with ſeveral <hi>Secrets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Courts, which will diſcover the true
Source of the <hi>Preſent War</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Emperor</hi> of
<hi>Germany</hi> and<pb facs="tcp:104896:6"/>the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> and give a Glimps
of the Private Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Springs which have put all <hi>Europe</hi>
into the <hi>Hurly burly</hi> 'tis now in.</p>
            <p>I have but this more to ſay, That we hope to be more Speedy in
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Remainder of theſe <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> than we have hitherto
been in the Former <hi>Volumes.</hi> Reader, Adieu.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT makes me ſmile ſometimes, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how often I was
put to it for an Addreſs ſuitable to the Manners of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi>
and the particular Mode of <hi>Paris,</hi> when I firſt arriv'd at this City:
For, thou know'ſt, we had other Employments, than to learn Faſhions and
Conge's at <hi>Palermo.</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104896:14"/>The Mind of a <hi>Slave</hi> is
dejected under the Circumſtances of his <hi>Captivity;</hi> ſo that he has
not Leiſure to regard any Thing, but how to accompliſh his daily Task, and
to pleaſe his <hi>Patron.</hi> All his Study and Care is bent upon this, and
there's no Room left for Generous Thoughts; Neither has he Means or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to
venture on Projects, or improve the Preſent Occurrences in Order to his
Future Happineſs: Nay, he hardly dares think of ever being Happy again. This
was my Caſe, and I believe 'twas not much better with thee.</p>
               <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all the Rigorous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>I</hi> had,
the <hi>Baſtinado's,</hi> Kicks, Bruiſes, Cuts and Wounds, I receiv'd from
the Hands of that Barbarous <hi>Giafer,</hi> my <hi>Maſter,</hi> which made
me ſometimes Incapable of doing him any Service by Day, or of taking any
Reſt my ſelf by Night, I was reſolv'd to find ſome ſpare Time for
<hi>Books.</hi> I roſe Early, and went Late to Sleep; neglecting no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein I cou'd apply my ſelf to Study. The Acquaintance I had with that
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Carpenter, our Friend, was of Singular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to me in
this Kind: For, thou may'ſt remember, he was well ſtock'd with many Ancient
and Learned <hi>Treatiſes.</hi> He furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with <hi>Plutarch,
Polybius, Strabo, Pliny,</hi> and other <hi>Hiſtories.</hi> All which, and
many more, I devour'd with Greedineſs; for I had a ſtrong Appetite to
Knowledge. And after my <hi>Redemption,</hi> I paſs'd away ſome Time in the
<hi>Academies,</hi> where I learn'd the Knotty<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104896:14"/>Tricks of
<hi>Logick,</hi> how to ſplit <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and chain
one Impertinent <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> to the Tail of another to Eternity. I
alſo ran through a Courſe of <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> and other
<hi>Sciences.</hi> Neither was I altogether Ignorant of <hi>Men:</hi> For the
Reading of <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> fits a Man the better to make Practical
Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Affairs of the <hi>World.</hi> To which alſo,
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> is not a little helpful, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our Obſervations
on the various Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>People,</hi> Mens Perſonal Diſpoſitions
and Singularities, with the Humours and Cuſtoms Peculiar to this or that
<hi>Nation.</hi> For theſe things depend many Times on the Difference of the
<hi>Climate,</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Soil,</hi> the
<hi>Qualities</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of their
<hi>Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But neither <hi>Hiſtory, Logick</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy,</hi>
were able to efface the Impreſſions of my Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Years, or unteach me the
<hi>Manners</hi> in which I had been Educated from my Infancy. I brought
<hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> along with me even to
<hi>Paris.</hi> And becauſe I had not been uſed to diſſemble the
Profeſſion and Carriage of a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> during my Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in
<hi>Sicily;</hi> I was at a Loſs in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, when I came Firſt
hither.</p>
               <p>How often have I been like to diſcover my ſelf by
Pronouncing the Sacred <hi>Biſmillah,</hi> either when I ſat down to Eat,
or put a Glaſs of Water to my Lips; or, when I begun any other Action of
Importance? So likewiſe in uttering the <hi>Handillah,</hi> after a Repaſt,
or when any Thing happen'd which prompted me to praiſe <hi>Ged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104896:15"/>When I met any of my Acquaintance in the
Streets, I was apt to forget that I had a Hat on. And inſtead of putting off
that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Faſhion of the <hi>Franks,</hi> I laid my Hand on my
Breaſt, and ſometimes bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo low, that my Hat fell off from my Head,
before I was ſenſible of my Error.</p>
               <p>If I had Occaſion to addreſs my ſelf to a
<hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Quality,</hi> I was ready to take up the Bottom of his
Cloak, Gown or Robe, and to Kiſs it in Token of Reverence, as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
is in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> when we ſalute the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees.</hi> Nay,
ſometimes I could not forbear falling on my Knee, or proſtrate on the
Ground before <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and thoſe of his High
<hi>Dignity.</hi> All which, nevertheleſs, paſſed only for
Clowniſhneſs, and want of <hi>Courtly</hi> Education, which teaches the
Nice <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of Addreſs. They took me for a Kind of
<hi>Moldavian</hi> Ruſtick, without any farther Jealouſy. Or perhaps, they
ſmil'd at all this, as ſome Singular Caprice or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, like that of the
<hi>Philoſopher Paſicles,</hi> who coming to ſalute a Great
<hi>Captain,</hi> and the Ceremony of thoſe Times requiring him to touch the
<hi>Captain</hi>'s Knee, he laid his Hand on his <hi>Genitals.</hi> At which
the <hi>Captain</hi> being affronted, and thruſting his Hand away with
Scornful Words; <hi>What!</hi> ſays the <hi>Philoſopher, does not that Part
belong to you, as well as your Knees?</hi> It often diverts my Melancholy, to
conſider how many Errors of this Kind I have committed, not through
Ignorance, or any Cynical Humour, but only in pure Overſight, and
Forgetfulneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104896:15"/>It was a long Time ere I could frame my
Fingers to handle a <hi>Knife</hi> and <hi>Fork</hi> at <hi>Meals,</hi> as is
the Univerſal Cuſtom in theſe <hi>Weſtern Parts;</hi> Whereas thou
knoweſt, we make uſe of no other <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in Eating, but our
<hi>Fingers</hi> and <hi>Teeth.</hi> Whence it was, that I could not
ſometimes forbear thruſting my Hand into a whole Diſh of Meat; which is
counted a great Indecency in <hi>France.</hi> And after I was reconciled to
thoſe Nicer Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Voluptuouſneſs, ſo as to Carve my Meat
<hi>à la Mode;</hi> yet when once I had it on my own <hi>Plate,</hi> I
laid aſide thoſe Tools as Uſeleſs, and tore it aſunder with my
Fingers and Teeth, feeding <hi>à la Turceſque,</hi> as the
<hi>French</hi> call it; that is, like a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, no Body ſuſpected me; but all theſe
Miſcarriages paſs'd for <hi>Moldavian Barbariſms,</hi> the ſalvage
<hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of that my ſuppoſed <hi>Country.</hi> I tell thee, that
tho' the Manner of Eating among the <hi>French,</hi> ſeem to have ſomething
more of Neatneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy in it; yet it appears full of Softneſs and
Luxury, and I cannot in Reaſon prefer it to the more Natural and Simple
Method of <hi>Diet,</hi> us'd in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Neither wou'd the
<hi>Franks</hi> themſelves condemn us for Salvages in this Point, as they
commonly do, did they but conſider, that this Negligence very well becomes
<hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Sword;</hi> and that in their <hi>Campagnes,</hi> their
own <hi>Generals</hi> are ambitious to appear Careleſs in every Thing
relating to their Body.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who brought 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104896:16"/>the Greateſt Part of the <hi>World</hi> under their Power,
ſhunn'd all Fineneſſes in <hi>Diet</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,</hi> till
ſuch Time as their <hi>Manners</hi> were debauched, and their <hi>Empire</hi>
in its <hi>Decline.</hi> Our <hi>Annals</hi> record, That when <hi>Sultan
Selim</hi> lay down with his Army before a certain Place, and the
<hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> ſent <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners</hi> to
treat with him about a Surrender; they found him at Dinner, which conſiſted
only of Two or Three <hi>Onions,</hi> a little <hi>Salt</hi> and
<hi>Bread.</hi>

                  <hi>Hiſtories</hi> alſo relate of the Faithful <hi>Omar,
Succeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> That when he was with his Army not

City, ſent a <hi>Spy</hi> into the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> to obſerve their Diſcipline, and bring him a
Lively Character of their <hi>General.</hi> The <hi>Spy</hi> went according to
his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Order. And having tarried ſome Time in the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Camp, returned again, and thus ſpoke to the
<hi>Governour.</hi>

and Modeſty. I ſaw <hi>Omar</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> at the Head of his

ſaw him take out from thence hard Cruſts of Bread, ſhaking off the Husks
of Millet which ſtuck to them; and ſaying, <hi>In the Name of God,</hi> he
Eat heartily of the ſame. Then he drank Water out of a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Bottle
hanging by his Side; And when he had done, he ſaid, <hi>Praiſe be to

Let me go where I will, he's always at ſome Diſtance from me. If I ſtand
ſtill, ſo does he: Or if I turn back, he's quickly at my Heels. I have
endeavour'd by all the Prudent Methods I could take to drop him in the Crowd of
People, or in the <hi>Churches:</hi> But all in vain; for ſtill I encounter
with the ſame Face. He purſues me like my Shadow. Neither Coach nor Boat,
Land or Water, Houſe or Alley, can reſcue me from the Fellow's Eyes, who is
more quick-ſighted than <hi>Argus,</hi> and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler than <hi>Mercury.</hi>
He is very Cunning alſo in this Buſineſs, and as dexterous as a Jugler,
conveying himſelf when he pleaſes out of my Sight; yet preſently after,
he's in View a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And if I chance to loſe him in the Dark, I am ſure to
find him not far from my Lodging next Morning.</p>
               <p>This is it which gives me ſo much Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and pierces
me with a Thouſand Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104896:18"/>For I know not what to
conjecture of this Fellow's Deſign. Sometimes I think he is employed by
<hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> to watch my Motions, obſerve what Houſes and
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I frequent, and trace me in all my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. And I am the more
confirm'd in this Suſpicion, when I reflect on my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Impriſonment in
this City, and the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it. Beſides, when I went Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to
ſee <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> this Spark fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me near to the
Door: And tho' I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there Two full Hours, yet when I came out, I had not
walked a Hundred Paces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw him again, footing it after me in a
Careleſs manner, with his Arms folded, and his Eyes fix'd on the Ground, as
if he knew Nothing of the Matter. Theſe are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Circumſtances, that
he is ſet at Work by the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> or ſome Body elſe, to
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But when on the other Side, I conſider, that if the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> ſuſpected me, he might go a nearer Way to work, and
ſeize me in my Chamber, where my Letters would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me; this Thought
vaniſhes, and I am at a Loſs what to think.</p>
               <p>Then comes into my Mind the Encounter I had once with my
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Maſter, who ſtrove to ſet the Rabble upon me in the
Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> but my better Stars delivered me out of his and
their Hands, whilſt, for ought I know, he drew upon himſelf the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
he deſign'd for me. However, when I reflect on that Paſſage, I am apt to
think he<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104896:19"/>may be now in <hi>Paris,</hi> and having by ſome
Accident ſeen me go in or out at my Lodging, contrives how to revenge
himſelf on me, and uſes this Fellow's Aſſiſtance in compaſſing
his Ends. Perhaps, think I, he will cauſe me to be ſtabb'd or piſtoll'd
at ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Seaſon; Or, he will find out ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, leſs
noiſy and more malicious to diſpatch me. It may be he ſeeks to entrap me,
and render me Obnoxious to the <hi>State.</hi> I have a thouſand Imaginations
about it, and know not what to conclude. I value not my ſelf, nor am I
careful to prolong a Miſerable Life for my own Sake. All that I can hope to
enjoy in this World, would come far ſhort of tempting me to skreen my ſelf
from the Stroke of Death, by any Action Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>
and a Man. But the Duty and Affection I owe to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>'s
Service makes me willing to live, till I have acquitted my ſelf of my
<hi>Province</hi> with perfect Succeſs, that ſo I may return to
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with Honour. And then I care not how ſoon I poſt
to that Unknown World, where all the Generations of Mortals take up their
Eternal Reſt: For in this there's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Labour and Grief.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, I know not what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to uſe in this
Emergency; Whether I'd beſt to ſpeak to this Fellow, or diſſemble my
Suſpicion; Whether it will be ſafe to truſt this Event to the General
<hi>Providence,</hi> or to ſacrifice him that gives me ſo much Diſquiet,
and ſo ſecure my Peace. I could eaſily have<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104896:19"/>him
diſpatch'd without any farther Noiſe. But then my Conſcience would
trouble me with after-Claps, leſt I ſhould have Murder'd a Man without
Reaſon, which is expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Beſides, I
ſhould always ſtand in Fear of ſome Diſcovery, I proteſt, I am at a
Loſs for want of Ample Inſtructions in ſuch Caſes as theſe. And I am
weary of mentioning what I have ſo often intimated already to the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> without any Direct Anſwer.
However, I will do what my Reaſon ſuggeſts, and leave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to
<hi>Deſtiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Happy <hi>Miniſter,</hi> the Affairs of this World are full of
dark Windings and <hi>Meanders;</hi> and we have all need of a Guide or a Clew
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us through 'em. May that <hi>Omnipreſent</hi> aſſiſt us,

               <p>THY Venerable <hi>Diſpatch</hi> I received with Kiſſes,
and a Tranſport of Joy. I Thrice touch'd my Eye-lids with the Paper of High
Eſteem, and as oft I laid it to my Breaſt. I broke up the Seals with
Modeſty and Reverence, and my Greedy Eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Lines of Profound
Wiſdom; the <hi>Sentences</hi> and <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> worthy to be written

Oracle</hi> of the <hi>Age!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Glory be to <hi>God,</hi> who has neither Beginning nor End; Who

Jeremiel, Haſmariel,</hi> and on all the Happy <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his

Peace</hi> to the <hi>True Believers</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> and
<hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damn'd,</hi> after they have
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104896:20"/>their <hi>Penance</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> and
the <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Wrath</hi> ſhall be Expir'd.</p>
               <p>An Univerſal Charity dilates my Heart; I embrace with Love all
the Creatures of <hi>God.</hi> This is owing to the Seaſonable Arrival of thy
Letter: For at the Moment when that came, I was plung'd in ſo deep a
Melancholy, that I cou'd hardly afford a Kind Thought for any Thing on Earth,
and I perfectly hated my ſelf. I have theſe Fits of Sadneſs often, it
being an Effect of my <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At thoſe Seaſons Life appears an Inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Burden,
and all the Buſtle and Noiſe of Mortals a Vain Fatigue. My Senſes, which
at other Times adminiſter Delight and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are now the Inſtruments
of Anguiſh and Pain. Every Thing I ſee and hear, diſguſts me. I abhor
my Neceſſary Food. Neither can the Sweeteſt Odors, or ſofteſt Strains
of <hi>Muſick</hi> bring me into a better Temper; Till Sleep Eclipſes the
Light of my buſy Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and puts out every glaring Thought. Then my
<hi>Soul</hi> takes her Repoſe: And ſtealing from my <hi>Body,</hi> enters
into the Shady Vale of <hi>Viſions,</hi> and ſports with Innocent
<hi>Idea's.</hi> Thus having diverted my ſelf with jumbling Monſtrous
<hi>Eſſences</hi> together, and hurling one <hi>Chimaera</hi> at another, I
return again to my <hi>Body,</hi> and Sighing awake, griev'd that I cou'd not
longer ſtay in that <hi>Mock-World,</hi> where I cou'd have wiſh'd my
Reſidence for Ever, rather than in <hi>this,</hi> which gives me ſo much
Real Pain. Thus is my Anguiſh renew'd with the Morning. Light is more
Irkſom to<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104896:21"/>me than Darkneſs, and the Day which brings Joy
to other Mortals is more terrible to me than Night, and the Shadow of
Death.</p>
               <p>I complain to the <hi>Elements,</hi> but they will not hear or
regard me. All <hi>Nature</hi> ſeems to laugh at my Affliction, and the
Beaſts of the Field triumph o'er me. As for Men, here are none but
<hi>Infidels,</hi> my profeſs'd Enemies to whom I can vent my Sorrows: And
I'm aſham'd to make a Woman my <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> tho' 'twere my own
Mother, who lives in <hi>Paris,</hi> and daily ſees me.</p>
               <p>If in this dolorous Condition I prepare my ſelf with the
accuſtom'd <hi>Purifications</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and addreſs to the
<hi>Omnipotent,</hi> I know not where to find him: His <hi>Eſſence</hi> is
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and flies from Human Thought. I call him aloud by his Ninety
Nine Adorable Names, but receive no Anſwer. I repeat his Incomprehenſible
Attributes, but all to no Purpoſe. In a Word, I ſay and do all that the
<hi>Law</hi> enjoyns, the <hi>Prophet</hi> counſels, Holy Perſons
recommend, or my own Reaſon ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, as proper Means to obtain the
Favor of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a Redreſs of my Calamity: But find no Comfort.
And, for ought I know, that <hi>Spaniard</hi> might as ſoon be heard, who
being ignorant what <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to uſe, rehears'd the
Four and Twenty Letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> deſiring <hi>God</hi> to
form ſuch Words out of 'em, as beſt expreſs'd the <hi>Petitioner</hi>'s
Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>I tell thee, Illuſtrious <hi>Prelate,</hi> after I'm tyr'd
with Vocal Devotions, I have Recourſe<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104896:21"/>to Contemplation. I
examine my Paſt Life, and find that I my ſelf am the Source of my own
Melancholy, in not ſtrictly obeying the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,</hi> and the Dictates of my
Conſcience: And all this, for the Sake of Loyalty to the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> and in Confidence of the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>'s Diſpenſation. Now
I ask of thee, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Lawful to commit a Thouſand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I may
only acquit my ſelf fairly in One Virtue? Or, to think, that in ſuch
Caſes, the <hi>Mufti</hi> has Power to diſannul the Expreſs, Poſitive
Injunctions of our <hi>Holy Law-giver?</hi> Is the <hi>Empire</hi> of the
<hi>Faithful</hi> to be ſerv'd by the Infidelity and Prophaneneſs of
<hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans?</hi> Or the Truth to be ſupported by Lyes and
Perjuries?</p>
               <p>I tremble to think what a Confuſion I ſhall be in, when the
<hi>Prophet</hi> ſhall reproach me, That I have preferr'd the Favour of Men,
to the Smiles of <hi>Heaven.</hi> I know not what to do. Oh, that I were in the
Parching <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts</hi> of <hi>Libya,</hi> or any the moſt Unfrequented
Solitude of <hi>Egypt!</hi> A Companion of Dragons, and other Horrid Monſters
of <hi>Africk!</hi> rather than in this <hi>Station,</hi> which renders my Life
a Hell upon Earth, and torments me with Half the Diſquiets of the
<hi>Damn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this appears too Extravagant and Deſperate a Thought,
let me at leaſt wiſh my ſelf at <hi>Fez,</hi> the meaneſt of thy
Slaves, or of the Incomparable <hi>Muſu Abul Yahyan,</hi> of whom thy laſt
Letter gave ſo high a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. I have addreſs'd a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to
him,<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104896:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>hoping for the Honour of his Friendſhip and
Correſpondence.</p>
               <p>Let not the Liberty I've taken to tell thee of my Sadneſs,
diſcourage thee from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: But reſt aſſur'd, that whenever thou
ſhalt vouchſafe me a Letter, tho' I were in the Agonies of Death, 'twould
call me back again.</p>

               <head>LETTER V. To the Same.</head>
               <p>I Sent a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> ſome <hi>Moons</hi> paſt to the
<hi>Cadileſquer</hi> of <hi>Romeli, Guardian</hi> of the <hi>Imperial Canons,
Interpreter</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Equity;</hi> wherein I inform'd
him of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that were made in order to a <hi>Peace</hi> between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Now I can aſſure thee, that
<hi>Peace</hi> is concluded, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> Sign'd on both Sides by
the Two <hi>Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not repeat what I particularly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that
<hi>Grandee.</hi> My Letters are all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the <hi>Divan,</hi> and
Regiſter'd. Yet it will not be unwelcome perhaps to thee, to hear with what
Niceneſs of <hi>Punctilio,</hi> theſe <hi>Infidel Miniſters</hi> met to
accompliſh an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, whereon depends the Intereſt and Honor of their
Reſpective <hi>Maſters,</hi> the Happineſs of the Two <hi>Kingdoms,</hi>
and the General Byaſs of all the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a little <hi>Iſland</hi> form'd by the River
<hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> call'd the Iſle of <hi>Pheaſants,</hi> through the
Middle of which, a Line is drawn which exactly ſeparates the
<hi>Territories</hi> of both <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</hi> This Place was agreed on for
the Interview of the Two <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Each had his Bridge to enter the
<hi>Iſland</hi> in that Part which belong'd to his <hi>Maſter.</hi> And
over the Line of Separation was erected a large <hi>Divan</hi> 
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104896:25"/>or <hi>Council-Room,</hi> to be enter'd only by Two Private
Doors, one out of <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi>'s Lodgings, rais'd on the
<hi>French</hi> Side of the <hi>Council-Room,</hi> the other out of <hi>Don
Louis D' Aro</hi>'s Apartment, built on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Side.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> was accompany'd by
ſeveral <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and
above Sixty other Perſons of <hi>Quality,</hi> with a Guard of Four Hundred
Horſe and Foot, to ſecure their Bridges, and the Place of Conference. In a
word, Things were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with ſo much Moderation and good Succeſs, that
the <hi>Mareſchal de Gramont</hi> was ſent <hi>Embaſſador
Extraordinary</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and receiv'd at that <hi>Court</hi>
with Infinite Civilities and Honour.</p>
               <p>The Subject of his <hi>Negotiation,</hi> was to treat of a
<hi>Match</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the
<hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> His Conduct and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs were ſuch, as
ſoon procur'd the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King</hi>'s Conſent: And from that Time
the <hi>Marſhal</hi> approach'd the <hi>Infanta</hi> with more than ordinary
Submiſſions, eſteeming her now as the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
Soon after this, the <hi>Nuptial Contract,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> was
mutually Sign'd, to the Immenſe Joy of the <hi>Subjects</hi> of both Sides,
who were very glad to exchange the Toils and Calamities of <hi>War,</hi> for
the Sweets and Profit of <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be needleſs to inſert here all the
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> on which they agreed. Two will be worth the Knowledge of the
Supreme <hi>Divan.</hi> And thoſe are, the Releaſe of <hi>Charles Duke</hi>
of<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104896:25"/>
                  <hi>Lorrain,</hi> on the <hi>Spaniſh King</hi>'s Side;
And on the Part of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> to the Free Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and
Enjoyment of all his Eſtates, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Dignities and Priviledges, as the
<hi>Firſt Prince</hi> of the <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> with the
<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Bourgoigne</hi> and
<hi>Breſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little before theſe <hi>Articles</hi> were Sign'd, the Young
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> dy'd ſuddainly, not having ſeen Twelve
<hi>Moons.</hi> I mention'd the Birth of this <hi>Royal</hi> Infant in one of
my Letters, and the Extraordinary Solemnities that were made thereupon by the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> at
<hi>Foreign Courts.</hi> Theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> appear in all things too
paſſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affected with the Glories of our Mortal State, which at the
Height are but Tranſient Shadows, or ſomething leſs Conſiderable.</p>
               <p>I'm amaz'd at the bold Rebellion of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Aleppo,</hi> and that he ſhou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cheat the <hi>Empire</hi>
with ſo ſtale an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, as a Sham-Son of <hi>Amurat.</hi> Yet it
ſeems he made a Conſiderable Progreſs under this Pretence. Some were glad
of Novelty, others were frightned out of their Allegiance: Whilſt only a few
ſerv'd his Intereſt in pure Diſcontent and Hopes to amend their Fortune.
The Country People are generally oppreſs'd by their <hi>Governours,</hi> and
'is no Wonder if they take up Arms for one that promiſes to deliver 'em from
their Calamities. This is the Uſual Pretext of all Innovations in the State.
The Soldiers alſo are defrauded of their<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104896:26"/>due Pay; and then
they're ready to Fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the next <hi>General</hi> that brings moſt
Money with him. Neither are there wanting Male-contents among the
<hi>Grandees</hi> at ſuch Times, to foment and abett an
<hi>Inſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Events proceed from the Ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the
<hi>Supreme Miniſters,</hi> who alone are Reſponſible for the
Miſcarriages of the <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> the Frame of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Government is out of Order; I wiſh <hi>Fate</hi> does not
pull it in Pieces, as a Neceſſary Step to its Amendment. Adieu</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Wiſh thee all Imaginable Joy of thy New <hi>Dignity;</hi>
yet queſtion, whether thou or thy <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> be the Happier
Man. 'Tis a vaſt <hi>Honour</hi> indeed, and attended with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Profit,
to ſerve in this <hi>Station</hi> the moſt High, moſt Potent and moſt
Invincible <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> on Earth. But at the ſame Time, there's Infinite
Toil and Fatigue in it, with Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Perils. From all which the

                  <hi>Muzlu</hi> is now deliver'd, and they are
become thy Portion.</p>
               <p>As for him, I cannot but eſteem him Happy, in that he has got
Permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his <hi>Country-Seat,</hi> out of the Crowd and
Noiſe of the City, and from the Stifling Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of <hi>State,</hi>
which choak the more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Natural Delights of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Now
he is fully reſtor'd to the <hi>Elements,</hi> and to himſelf; whereas
before, the perpetual Hurry of the <hi>Court,</hi> made him in Part a Stranger
to Both: For there a Man inſenſibly loſes Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his own
moſt Intimate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: His Spirit is alienated amidſt the Multiplicity
of his Concerns; 'tis ſtretch'd on the Rack of Ten Thouſand Cares and
Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudes; 'tis divided, ſhatter'd and rent in Pieces.</p>
               <p>Beſides, were he as free from theſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Thoughts
as a <hi>Santone;</hi> yet the very Neceſſity of living always in a City,
was enough to render him Miſerable. For I eſteem ſuch a Confinement, no
better than a Priſon at Large; and not far from being buried Alive.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> has the Advantage of all
the Cities in the World, for the Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of its Situation; the
Houſes being ſo pleaſantly intermix'd with fair Gardens, and the Streets
refreſh'd with cool Breezes from the Sea. It looks at a Diſtance like a
Town in a Wood; or one may term it, a Foreſt compos'd of Minarets and
Cypreſſes. The Terraſſes afford agreeable Proſpects of the 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104896:27"/>Neighbouring Fields and Mountains: And 'tis pleaſant to
ſtand on the Water-Side, and view the Innumerable Variety of Boats and
Veſſels Sailing from one Port to another, with all the other
Divertiſements on the Sea, and the Beautiful Mixture of Palaces and Groves,
Chioſcs and Gardens, <hi>Seraglio's</hi> and Villages which grace the
Oppoſite Shore. O <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Cities, Miſtreſs</hi> of
<hi>Kingdoms, Glory</hi> of <hi>Nations, Commandreſs</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>How often do I languiſh to ſee the Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<hi>Creſcents,</hi> the Triumphant Enſigns of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> on the
Tops of the Minarets in the <hi>Imperial</hi> City? How oft do I wiſh my
ſelf proſtrate on the Carpets of the <hi>Sacred Moſques,</hi> in the
devout Aſſemblies of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> Adoring the <hi>Eternal</hi> in
Perfection of <hi>Sanctity?</hi> Whereas, now I'm forc'd to go into the

<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> and pray to that which has no Life, nor Senſe, nor

               <p>How do I envy the Bleſſed State of the meaneſt Artizan in
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who daily feeds on the wholeſom <hi>Pillaw</hi> of
the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and drinks the delectable <hi>Sherbets,</hi> or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
tinctur'd with the Rich Fruits of <hi>Greece?</hi> Whereas, I am compell'd to

Dainty. And to cloak their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs they corrupt their own
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> and forge a Toleration from the <hi>Meſſias</hi>

Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the moſt Temperate and
Abſtemious Man in the World, and both in his Words and Actions preach'd up
thoſe Vertues to others; having often expreſly declar'd to his
<hi>Diſciples, That he came not to aboliſh the Law, but to refine and
perfect it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was <hi>Circumcis'd</hi> on the Eighth Day after his
<hi>Nativity,</hi> according to the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
conſtant Practice of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In a Word,
through the whole Courſe of his Life, he never deviated from the
<hi>Traditions</hi> of his <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> of the
<hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, he frequently argued againſt the many Trivial
<hi>Superſtitions</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who evacuated the more
<hi>Eſſential</hi> Points of the <hi>Law,</hi> by ſuperinducing a Number
of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> But he never open'd his Mouth
againſt any Poſitive <hi>Precept;</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104896:28"/>ſuch as were
thoſe which limited the Choice they were to make of <hi>Meats,</hi>
diſtinguiſhing the <hi>Impure</hi> from the <hi>Clean.</hi> Yet, the
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> delude themſelves with a Falſe Belief, that he gave
'em a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> to eat any Thing without Caution or
Reſerve.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that they defile themſelves with
<hi>Swines-Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Creeping Things,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> is in
all their Diſhes. They ſcruple not to eat of that which died of it ſelf,
and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet as freely with what was knock'd down or ſtrangl'd, as we wou'd
do with the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> that was kill'd in
Pronouncing the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Shambles</hi> here
afford no other Proviſion but ſuch as this; and he that will not Eat that
which is an Abomination to a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> muſt be contented with
<hi>Herbs.</hi> This I reckon as one of the Greateſt of my Misfortunes, and
it makes me burn with Deſire to return to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, after all, I ſhou'd think my ſelf far more Happy, if I
might have the Liberty to ſpend the Reſt of my Days in my <hi>Native</hi>
Country: So great an Admirer I am of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, and Solitude. And 'tis for
this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I count thy <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> a Happy Man, in having the
Privilege of a ſweet Retirement; where he may take Breath from the vain
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Buſtle of Mortals.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, there is a <hi>Species</hi> of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in
thy <hi>Employment:</hi> And thou can'ſt not be call'd Miſerable, ſo long

no doubt, is a neceſſary Point of Piety. And we have been no leſs

Either of us wou'd have counted it an Irreligious Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, if we had ſeen

All theſe, I own, are Commendable Exerciſes. But, methinks, they are not

Hypocriſy, and the devout Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who think to mock
<hi>God</hi> with <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Empty Forms.</hi> It were much

agree in aſſerting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be a Naſty Sort of

and that they were eſteem'd the <hi>Scum</hi> and <hi>Filth</hi> of the

Authority; adds, That <hi>Moſes,</hi> one of the <hi>Exil'd Lepers,</hi>
being a Man of Wit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among them, when he ſaw the Grief and
Confuſion of his Brethren, bid them be of good Cheer, and neither truſt the
<hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but only confide in him, and
obey his Counſel: For that he was ſent from <hi>Heaven</hi> to be their
<hi>Conductor</hi> out of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and to Protect them from all their
Enemies. Upon which the <hi>People</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Courſe to take,
ſurrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to his Diſpoſal, from which Time he
became their <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> leading them through the
<hi>Deſarts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where they committed great Rapine and
Spoil, putting Man, Woman and Child to the Sword, burning their Cities, and
laying all Things deſolate. Dear <hi>Dgnet,</hi> What could be ſaid worſe

               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> is gone to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and when I
mention his Name, it is with a profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; for, he was the Greateſt
of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104896:32"/>Prophets.</hi> Yet give me Leave to have
ſome Regard for my own Reaſon. He was but a <hi>Mortal</hi> as well as I;
and without doubt, was not exempt from <hi>Humane</hi> Frailties. He had the

Prieſts</hi> at <hi>Memphis,</hi> which none of his <hi>Nation</hi> could
boaſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf. Suffer me to tell thee my Thoughts frankly,
and without Diſguiſe. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology</hi> were the
only <hi>Sciences</hi> then in Vogue: And he being perfectly vers'd in all the
<hi>Myſteries</hi> and Secrets of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Wiſdom, 'twas no hard
Task for him to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Rude and Ignorant <hi>Sont</hi> of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> with a profound Attach and Veneration for his Perſon: And in
that diſtreſs'd Condition, to mold their flexible Spirits to what
Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>Suſpect me not for an <hi>Infidel</hi> or an
<hi>Atheiſt,</hi> becauſe I diſcourſe with this Freedom. I have heard
ſome of our <hi>Mollahs,</hi> ſay a great deal more in their Private

in the Exerciſe of our Reaſon, which taught even the Prophet
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, the Methods of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and getting a
Fame which ſhould know no End.</p>
               <p>I am not Ambitious, nor would I tempt thee to aſpire at an
undue Grandeur: But let us not be leſs than our ſelves, that is, Men, There
is no reaſon we ſhould be impos'd upon by <hi>Fabulous</hi> Reports of

               </head>
               <p>AT length, after a long Alienation, the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Conde</hi> is reſtor'd to the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour: For which, he is
oblig'd to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> I have already intimated in one
of my Letters, That this was agree'd on in the <hi>Treaty</hi> of
<hi>Peace</hi> between theſe Two <hi>Crowns,</hi> as an <hi>Article</hi>
Equivalent to that of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Releaſe,
ſollicited by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Now 'tis put in
Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Rebel Prince</hi> is receiv'd with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of
Careſſes, by the <hi>King, Queen-Mother, Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and the
whole <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is counted the Valianteſt Man of this Age; and was ſo
pronounc'd long ago by the <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> who is a Souldier of
no mean Character, both for his Judgment and Courage. He was once extremely
belov'd by all the <hi>French.</hi> But his Wildneſs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, with
the Deſtructive Effects of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> which he rais'd, chang'd
their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for a while into Indifference, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Ill-Will. But
now all's well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>He and his Brother the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conti,</hi>
ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom agree'd, being often the Heads of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Parties, during the
<hi>Minority</hi> of this <hi>King.</hi> And the Younger being
crump-Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104896:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Conde</hi> us'd to be a little
Sarcaſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, threatning to ſhave his uncourtly Back into the
Faſhion with his Sword.</p>
               <p>It is certain, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was very
wild and profuſe when Young, but now he begins to take ſoberer Meaſures.
During his Father's Life, he was call'd the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Engui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</hi>
And to reflect on the Parſimony of the Old Prince, he us'd to take ſeveral
Handfuls of Gold with one Hand, and fill a Purſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my
Father's Practice.</hi> Then he would turn the Purſe up-ſide down with
t'other Hand, and ſcattering the Gold among his <hi>Favourites,</hi> would
add, <hi>This is my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once as he was paſſing on Foot through a Town in
<hi>France,</hi> under his Father's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Chief
<hi>Magiſtrate</hi> of the Place, who was an Old Man, met him and begun to
make an <hi>Oration</hi> with the beſt <hi>Rhetorick</hi> he could. But the
<hi>Prince</hi> being in a Frolickſom Humour, took Advantage of a very low
<hi>Conge</hi> the Old Gentleman made him, and leap'd over his Head, and
ſtood ſtill behind him. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> not taking any Notice of
this wild Prank, turned very gravely about, and addreſs'd himſelf with a
new Obeiſance, but not ſo low as the Former. However, the Nimble
<hi>Prince</hi> catch'd him upon the Half-Bent, and ſetting his Hands on the
Old <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi>'s Shoulders, whipt over again the ſecond Time; Which
quite ſpoil'd his intended <hi>Speech,</hi> to the great Diverſion of all
the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:104896:34"/>In his Youth he was much addicted to Women,
and took a peculiar Delight in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching <hi>Nuns:</hi> Which occaſion'd
the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> to reflect on him ſomething Satyrically once, when
he inform'd her that the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> Souldiers were guilty of great
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, ſome of them getting into the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,</hi> and
violating the Chaſtity of thoſe Conſecrated Females. For the
<hi>Queen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>If you had told me they broke into the
Wine-Cellars, I would believe you; for the Suiſſes are all known Drunkards.
But as for Amours with Nuns, none is ſo likely to make 'em as the Duke
of</hi> Enguien.</p>
               <p>However, all that I have ſaid, hinders not but that he is now
a Prudent Man, a good <hi>General,</hi> and Fortunate in recovering his
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi>'s Favour.</p>
               <p>In a Word, this <hi>Court</hi> is ſo overjoyed at the Marriage
of their <hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they
have no Room left for pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Reſentments. All Crimes are forgiven. And
the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf would be welcome at the <hi>Wedding,</hi> provided
he would be debonair, and good Company.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nuptials</hi> are only Celebrated by <hi>Proxy</hi> as
yet. But here are vaſt Preparations making for the compleating the
<hi>Ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the Iſſue of this <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>
will be, 'tis not eaſy to divine: But I doubt, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are
hatching Evil againſt the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> in Regard all the
<hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> are coming to an Agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104896:34"/>Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> Let not

               <p>I Believe thou wilt now receive from me the earlieſt News of a
Mighty Change, a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Revolution in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government.
Know then, that he whom I have ſo often mention'd under the Title of
<hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> in my Former Letters, the Eldeſt Son and
Rightful Heir of the <hi>Britiſh Kingdoms' Charles</hi> II. is reſtor'd to
the <hi>Throne</hi> of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,</hi> without Violence or
Blood-ſhed, by the Unanimous Conſent, and Earneſt Deſire of his
<hi>Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Young <hi>Prince</hi> has been an Exile for Twelve Years in
Foreign <hi>Courts,</hi> and has heard of as many ſeveral Alterations in the
State of his <hi>Dominions,</hi> during his Abſence; every Change producing a
New <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The <hi>Rebels</hi> had run over all
<hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s <hi>Politicks,</hi> and the Various <hi>Models</hi> of
<hi>Plato</hi> and other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who treated of 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104896:35"/>
                  <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi> to find out ſuch
<hi>Patterns</hi> as beſt ſuited with the Neceſſities and
<hi>Genius</hi> of that <hi>Nation.</hi> There is not a <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, Democracy</hi> and <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> which they did not
put in Practice to ſupport the <hi>Frame</hi> of that <hi>Government,</hi>
whoſe <hi>Baſis</hi> they had remov'd; for it was founded on a
<hi>Monarchy</hi> of a long and Hereditary Deſcent. And therefore all their
moſt Artificial Contrivances were Ineffectual, and they might as well have
endeavoured to make Buttreſſes for a Caſtle in the Air. In a Word, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo disjointed and weaken'd by
<hi>Civil Wars,</hi> Taxes, and the other Uſual Effects of Uſurpation and
Tyranny, that they had no other Way left to ſave their <hi>Nation</hi> from
utter Ruine, but by bringing their Lawful <hi>King</hi> back again, who is the
Angular Stone whereon all their Welfare and Intereſt is built.</p>
               <p>There is one Thing Remarkable in this Turn of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Affairs, That their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> landed and made his Triumphant Entry
into that <hi>Iſland,</hi> on the <hi>Anniverſary Day</hi> of his Birth.
Which puts me in Mind of what is Generally diſcourſed here at
<hi>Paris;</hi> That on the Day of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> there was ſeen a
Bright <hi>Star</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> was juſt
above the <hi>Meridian.</hi> From hence the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> of thoſe
Times predicted great Things concerning him. And thoſe of the Preſent Age,
who have ſeen his Fortunate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> preſage yet
greater Events to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104896:35"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> only knows what
<hi>Embryo's</hi> are in the Womb of Futurity; and we <hi>Muſſulmans</hi>
have no Reaſon to rejoyce at the Grandeur of any of theſe <hi>Infidel

with a <hi>Prince,</hi> has Something in it Extraordinary, and full of
Promiſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It was an Appearance of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which
render'd the Birth of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſo Illuſtrious, tho'
otherwiſe obſcure enough; when the <hi>Eaſtern Magi,</hi> directed by
ſuch a <hi>Star,</hi> came and found <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> in a <hi>Stable,</hi> and the <hi>Infant-Prophet</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a <hi>Manger,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Cradle.</hi> So we are told, That
<hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> portend the Misfortune or Death of
<hi>Great Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> and that all other <hi>Prodigies,</hi> whether in
<hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> have their proper Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>But whether theſe Obſervations be true or no, 'tis certain
this late baniſhed <hi>Prince,</hi> is return'd with Abundance of Splendor
and Advantage to his Native Royal Poſſeſſions. And I thought it would
be a Grand Neglect in me, to let one Poſt-Day paſs, before I gave thee an
Account of a <hi>Revolution</hi> ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all <hi>Europe,</hi>
and which is like to give a New Turn to the Affairs of moſt <hi>Chriſtian
Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, I know there is an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> from
<hi>England,</hi> reſiding at the <hi>Auguſt Port;</hi> which determines
the Quarrels of all the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on Earth. There are alſo Abundance 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104896:36"/>of <hi>Engliſh Merchants</hi> in the <hi>Imperial</hi>
City. They may have Feuds among one another. The Intereſt of ſome of them
is joyn'd with that of the <hi>Engliſh Rebels;</hi> others are for their
<hi>King.</hi> Therefore knowing of his <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> thou wilt be
better able to adjuſt all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nature, according to Reaſon,
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the Honour of the Majeſtick <hi>Port.</hi> For this
<hi>King</hi> makes already a greater Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure than any of his
<hi>Progenitors,</hi> and therefore his Friendſhip is not to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd.</p>

               <p>OH that I were in one of the <hi>Pyramids</hi> near the City
where thou reſideſt, ſhut up in Tremendous Darkneſs, in the moſt
Obſcure and Horrible Vault of the <hi>Royal</hi> Pile! That I might
converſe with the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, hugg
<hi>Daemons</hi> in my Arms, and run the <hi>Gerit</hi> with
<hi>Hobgoblins</hi> and all the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Night round the
<hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Cheops,</hi> or up and down the diſmal Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, or in
the Neſt of <hi>Bats, Screech-Owls, Harpies,</hi> and the reſt of the

Eternal <hi>Mummies,</hi> ſome of them before <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood,</hi>
and the Reſt after, if the Story be true. <hi>God</hi> knows whether it be or
no: That's Nothing to me: But I have a ſtrong Inclination to try what I can
find in thoſe Antique <hi>Monuments,</hi> after all the Search of ſo many
<hi>Travellers.</hi> I have a Specifick Sort of Melancholy upon me, which
cannot be vented any other Way, than by keeping Company with the <hi>Dead,</hi>
or having Ten Hundred Thouſand ugly rampant <hi>Spirits</hi> dancing their
<hi>Infernal</hi> Meaſures about me, and grinning like <hi>Babboons</hi> of
<hi>Hell.</hi> Oh, <hi>God!</hi> How<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104896:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>'twould ſet me
a Laughing? An Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Nature would eaſe my Spleen, and
reſtore me to a Good Humour.</p>
               <p>Are there no <hi>Beings</hi> extant, but thoſe which are every
Day expos'd to our Senſes? Or, is <hi>Nature</hi> Poorer than the Imagination
of a Mortal, which can form the <hi>Idea's</hi> of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of
<hi>Creatures</hi> that he never ſaw? I am cloy'd with the <hi>Crambe</hi> of
Objects and Joys which theſe Narrow <hi>Elements</hi> afford, and therefore
would fain grope out ſome New and Untry'd World, to find Refreſhment
in.</p>
               <p>But oh, my <hi>Mehemet,</hi> when I look toward the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> and behold the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> when my Eye

Limits to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> then I ſink into my ſelf, full of
Humility and Confuſion, becauſe I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly reproach'd the
<hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and caſt Obloquies on his <hi>Works.</hi> For all Things
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear admirably Beautiful and Perfect, and the leaſt Atome is large enough
to afford Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a Thouſand <hi>Souls.</hi> Every Thing in
<hi>Nature</hi> is pregnant and full of pleaſing Wonders: Yet I cannot be
free from theſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack Fits at certain Seaſons. I am ſometimes
the ſaddeſt and moſt Melancholy Man in the World. I take all things by
the wrong Handle, look on them through falſe Opticks, and yet perſuade my
ſelf I am in the Right, and ſee them in their true Complexion. Such is the
Fatal Sophiſtry of this black and ſullen Paſſion: It takes away the
Guſt and<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104896:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>Reliſh of the ſweeteſt Enjoyments.
And if the Contagion could poſſibly find Admittance among the
<hi>Bleſs'd</hi> Above; ſurely 'twould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their <hi>Paradiſe</hi> a
<hi>Hell,</hi> and would afford ſome Ground for the Fiction of the Ancient
<hi>Poets,</hi> who brought up the Uſe of <hi>Nepenthe</hi> among the
<hi>Gods,</hi> to appeaſe their Choler, and put 'em in a good Humour.</p>
               <p>I know not what that <hi>Drink</hi> was: But I tell thee, my
<hi>Nepenthe</hi> is a Glaſs of good <hi>Languedoc</hi> Wine, which is as
Rich, and far more Delicious than the Wines of <hi>Tenedos</hi> and
<hi>Mitylene.</hi> I once could boaſt of another Method to ſubdue my
Melancholy, by giving Battle to my Thoughts in open Field; but now I am fain to
have Recourſe to Stratagems and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades, trepanning the ugly, hideous
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> out of their ſtrong Retrenchments and Faſtneſſes
in the Spleen, by Generous Frolicks with Wine, Women and Muſick. I bury all
Care in profound Sleep, the Effect of brisk and free Drinking. And then I awake
as merry as a <hi>Lark;</hi> as young as if I'd been in <hi>Medea</hi>'s
Cauldron.</p>
               <p>What ſignifies it to pretend Sanctity in our Words and
Exteriour Carriage, whilſt at the ſame Time we are ready to burſt with
Malice, Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and a Thouſand more Vices? Whereas Wine
ſeaſonably drank, cures all theſe Diſtempers of the <hi>Soul,</hi>
makes a Miſer Liberal, a Cruel Man Tender, a Spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fellow Kind, melts
Stiff and Haughty Spirits into a Wonderful Softneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. In
fine, it makes a <hi>Lamb</hi> of a<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104896:38"/>
                  <hi>Lion,</hi> and
changes a <hi>Vultur</hi> to a <hi>Dove,</hi> puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and transforming
<hi>Souls</hi> into a Temper wholly <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we be ty'd to <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>Morality,</hi> never practis'd by thoſe who made them? All the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> were boon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi>
himſelf pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately drank the Juice of the Grape. Our <hi>Emperours</hi> and
<hi>Grandees</hi> do the ſame. The only Reaſon why they forbid it to their
<hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> is, leſt they ſhould grow too Wiſe, and ſtrive to
ſhake off the Yoke: For Wine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the Spirits, emboldens the Heart, and
transforms a <hi>Slave</hi> to a <hi>Lord</hi> in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. For want of
this Liquor, all <hi>Nations</hi> where the Vine grows not, have found out one
Beverage or another, as efficacious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Melancholy, and drive away
Sorrow from the Heart. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> make Wine of Rice. In my Country
they have another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating Drink, compounded with certain Roots. The
ſame is uſed in ſome Parts of <hi>Perſia.</hi> In theſe <hi>Weſtern
Provinces,</hi> they brew divers Sorts of Strong Liquors of Wheat, Barley,
Honey, Moloſſa's and other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. And they make Wine of Apples,
Pears, Cherries, Currans, and moſt Fruits that grow. I tell thee, my Friend,
there's no living, unleſs we ſometimes give <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> a New Ferment
to rouze her from her Lees.</p>
               <p>Yet let us practiſe a due Mediocrity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that
<hi>God</hi> gave us theſe Things for our Health and Refreſhment, and not
for our<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104896:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bane. In a Word, <hi>Mehemet,</hi> let us be
Merry and Wiſe.</p>

               <p>I Have taken ſome Pains; turn'd over a great many

               </p>
               <p>It is obſerv'd of him, that he was always Unfortunate in his

<hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> which ſeems to contradict that
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>
               <p>He was then a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and only <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> when the Famous <hi>Maſſacre</hi> of 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104896:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> was committed, with Deſign to

when he heard the <hi>Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> making toward his Chamber, where
he ſate with the Queen, he hid himſelf under her Garments as ſhe ſate
in a Chair. The <hi>Villains</hi> ruſhing in, ask'd for the <hi>King.</hi>
She with a great Aſſurance of Spirit, told 'em, <hi>He went out from her in

far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hurt. Which occaſion'd a Common Jeſt, <hi>That Queen</hi>
Margaret<hi>'s Smock, ſav'd King</hi> Henry<hi>'s Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Woman was call'd the <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> on the Score of her Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Amours, never denying any
Thing to her Lovers, and being ſeldom without Men of <hi>Science</hi> in her
Company. In a Word, King <hi>Henry</hi> look'd on himſelf as a Noted
<hi>Cuckold,</hi> and ſo gave her a Bill of <hi>Divorce.</hi> Her own Mother
<hi>Katharine de Medicis,</hi> was call'd the <hi>Fourth Fury of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Recorded of this Lady, that ſhe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd much with
<hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> who in an <hi>Enchanted Glaſs,</hi>
ſhew'd her who ſhou'd Reign in <hi>France</hi> for the Time to come.
Firſt appear'd this <hi>Henry</hi> IV. then <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. next
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and after him a Pack of <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who ſhould
aboliſh the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and govern the <hi>Nation</hi> themſelves.
This <hi>Glaſs</hi> is to be ſeen in the <hi>King's Palace</hi> to this
Day.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Henry</hi> IV's Second Wife, 'tis ſaid he never
enjoy'd a Peaceable Hour with her, but<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104896:39"/>when ſhe was
aſleep. They often fought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſhe ſpar'd not ſometimes to
Beat and Scratch him even in his Bed, ſo that he has been forc'd to quit the
Field, and take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in another Chamber. This <hi>Prince</hi> was tax'd
with Ingratitude towards his moſt Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, and want of Liberality
to all. It was a Common Saying of his <hi>Predeceſſor Henry</hi> III.
<hi>That he ſhar'd his Kingdom with his Loyal Servants and Friends.</hi> But
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. lov'd not to part with any Thing which he could handſomly
keep.</p>
               <p>Yet he was very obliging to his Miſtreſſes, and his
Paſſion for them carried him into many Irregularities. He was ſo deeply
enamour'd of one, that to enjoy her he ſign'd a Promiſe of
<hi>Marriage</hi> to her with his own <hi>Blood;</hi> which, one of his
<hi>Favourites</hi> ſeeing, tore the Paper in Pieces. The <hi>King</hi> being
incens'd at that, ſwore by the <hi>Belly</hi> of St. <hi>Gris,</hi> an
ordinary Oath with him, that this Perſon was mad. <hi>Yes,</hi> reply'd he,
<hi>but I wiſh I were the only Madman in the Kingdom.</hi> Thereby reflecting
on the <hi>King's</hi> Extravagancy. Another Time he gave Fifty Thouſand
Crowns, for one Night's Enjoyment of a Lady.</p>
               <p>I have many Years ago ſpoke of the <hi>Death</hi> of this
<hi>Prince,</hi> in my Letters to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the
<hi>Port.</hi> Now I will acquaint thee with one Circumſtance, to which I was
then a Stranger.</p>
               <p>It happen'd, that the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was
walking with ſeveral <hi>Nobles</hi> in the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> of
<hi>Bearn,</hi> a Town under his Juriſdiction,<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104896:40"/>waſh'd by
the River <hi>Pau.</hi> When on a ſudden all the <hi>Cows,</hi> (of which
there was a great Number in thoſe Fields) ran violently into the River, and
were there drown'd. The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> being aſtoniſh'd at this, as at a
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,</hi> writ down the Day and Hour when it happen'd, which prov'd
exactly the very ſame Time to a Minute, when <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was ſtabb'd
in his Coach by <hi>Ravaillac;</hi> as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> was ſoon
certify'd by <hi>Diſpatches</hi> which he receiv'd from the <hi>Court,</hi>
containing Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of that <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this may be pure <hi>Chance,</hi> for ought I know, but
there are Abundance of <hi>Symptoms</hi> of ſomething elſe. As for
<hi>Man,</hi> he is wholly a Stranger to himſelf, and the Secret Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own <hi>Soul</hi> are hid from him. How then can he know the Natures of
other Things, or be familiarly acquainted with the Occult Diſpoſitions of
<hi>Beaſts?</hi> The leaſt <hi>Worm</hi> or <hi>Inſect,</hi> baffles our
ſevereſt Scrutiny, and we are loſt in the Speculation of their
<hi>Embryo's.</hi> The moſt Silent and Inanimate Beings, proclaim aloud the
Folly of our boaſted Science: Every <hi>Atom</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi>
ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules our beſt <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Who then will pretend to unriddle
the more Uncommon <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> or trace the
Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of <hi>Eternal Deſtiny? Hiſtorians</hi> ſpeak variouſly of
this <hi>Parricide.</hi> Some ſay, the <hi>Villain</hi> was approv'd of at
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he was there rank'd in the Number
of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> 'Tis certain, he under went as horrible a Death, as the
Wit of Man could<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104896:40"/>invent, to puniſh his matchleſs
<hi>Treaſon.</hi> And it ſeems, the <hi>Judges</hi> that examin'd him, were
either afraid, or aſham'd to divulge what they heard from his Mouth: Obliging
themſelves by an Oath to Eternal Secrecy. <hi>Ravaillac</hi> himſelf own'd,
that he had Twice before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to kill the <hi>King,</hi> but was thruſt
back by one of his <hi>Nobles,</hi> who ſuſpected ſome ill Deſigns in

<hi>Sultan</hi> from the Rage of Mutineers, from a <hi>Jewiſh</hi>

Menaces of a Terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but as yet have

               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104896:42"/>When I liv'd in <hi>Aſia,</hi> an
<hi>Earthquake</hi> was almoſt as Common as the Yearly Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of
<hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter:</hi> And we took as little Notice of it, as we
did of Lightning, Hail or Rain. Beſides, one <hi>Muſſulman</hi>
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged another, and the General <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>True Believers</hi>
confirm'd us all, That we ought to be reſign'd to <hi>God,</hi> and to the
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of <hi>Eternal Deſtiny,</hi> whether it were for Pleaſure or
Pain, Good or Evil, Life or Death. But now I have been ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd to
theſe Convulſions of the <hi>Globe,</hi> (for I have not felt one above
theſe Two and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years) and am alſo ſeparated from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of
the <hi>Faithful;</hi> that I am become like the reſt of the World, and even
like theſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> Timorous, aſtoniſhed, void of Reaſon,
and of little or no Faith.</p>
               <p>My Mind at firſt, ſtagger'd as much as my Body, when I was
walking croſs my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and felt the Floor rock under me, with that
Singular Kind of Motion, which no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art or Force can imitate. I ſoon
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded 'twas an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> but knew not how to bear that Thought
with Indifference. Death is familiar to me in any other Figure, but that of
being ſo ſurprizingly buried alive. It appeared horrible to ſink on a
ſudden into an Unknown Grave, I knew not whither: Perhaps I might fall into
ſome Dark Lake of Water; or it may be, I might be drench'd in a River of
Fire, or be daſh'd on a Rock: For, who can tell the Diſpoſition of the
Caverns below, or what Sort of Apartments he ſhall<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104896:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>find under the Surface of the Earth? We walk on the Battlements of a
Marvellous Structure, a <hi>Globe</hi> full of Tremendous Secrets. And whether
<hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Deſtiny, Providence</hi> or <hi>Chance,</hi>
occaſion the Ruptures that we find are made in divers Parts of the Earth, it
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much, ſo long as we are in Danger of tumbling in. Such a
terrible Fall, would put the beſt <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in the World out of
Humour, and Spoil all his Reaſoning. I'm ſure, 'twould vex me thus in a
Trice to be plundered of my Thoughts. Which makes me either wonder at the
Vanity of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> if he threw himſelf into the flaming Chaſm
of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> only for the Sake of being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a <hi>God,</hi>
(as the common Report is); or, gives me Reaſon to conclude, he had ſome
other End in his Venturous Leap: Since 'tis not probable, that empty Fame could
be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by that Great <hi>Sage,</hi> as his Final Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. A much
eaſier way had <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who, diſguſted at his Ignorance of
the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> threw himſelf in,
to put an End to his Diſquiſitions, if the Story be true. But, I can hardly
believe the <hi>Stagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> was ſuch a Fool. I gueſs of other Men,
according to the Experience I have of my ſelf. I am as little ſollicitous
about Death as any Man; yet I ſhould be unwilling to hurle my ſelf out of
the World headlong, without a <hi>Firm</hi> or a <hi>Tefta,</hi> I love New
Experiments, but am not very fond of ſuch as take from us irrecoverably the
means of trying any more.</p>

<hi>Marſhal D' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luines,</hi> and
<hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> The Firſt was the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi>'s
Favourite; the Second was the <hi>King</hi>'s; As for the Third, he was
abſolute Maſter both of <hi>King, Queen</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Minority</hi> indeed, <hi>Queen
Mary de Medicis,</hi> the <hi>Relict</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. took the
<hi>Regency</hi> into her own Hands, and managed Things in an Arbitrary Manner.
But the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> with other <hi>Grandees,</hi>
not able to brook the Government of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, conſpired againſt her. Among
theſe were the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> Father to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bovillon.</hi> The Former was a
Bold Man, and durſt do any Thing that was Brave: The Latter was a Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Stateſman.</p>
               <p>They Caball'd not ſo privately, but the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi>
was acquainted with their Meetings, and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bovillon</hi>
was the Firſt who knew his <hi>Party</hi> was betrayed. This Intelligence was
brought him from aſſured Hands, whilſt he was ſitting with the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> and other <hi>Nobles</hi> at the
<hi>Place</hi> of their Private Rendezvous. Whereupon, he acquainted them with
it, exhorting all to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond immediately, leſt they ſhould be ſeized
on the Spot. But they retorting, That the <hi>Queen</hi> would not venture on
an Action of ſuch dubious Conſequence; He ſtarted up and took his Leave
of 'em, with theſe Words: 
<q rend="inline">"My Lords, you may follow your own 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104896:44"/>Counſel. I'll immediately to Horſe, and eſcape to

               </p>
               <p>His Words came to paſs, and the Effect was a diminutive
<hi>Civil War;</hi> when the <hi>Queen</hi> was forced to raiſe an Army, to
reduce this <hi>Prince</hi> to Obedience, the Reſt of his Party being
Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, as ſoon as ſhe heard of his Flight.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Diſturbances laſted, the <hi>Moors</hi>
were expell'd out of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Number of Six Hundred Thouſand.
Part of thoſe who liv'd toward the <hi>Maritime</hi> Coaſts, went by
<hi>Sea</hi> into <hi>Africk.</hi> The Reſt, whoſe Reſidence was farther
within Land, ſought a Paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains, and
ſo through the <hi>Southern Provinces</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> offering a

Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this Story may afford thee ſome Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Marſhal D' Ancre,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
Favourite; in his Life and Death, he was compared to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> being
qualified with the like Vertues and Vices, and having much the ſame Fortune;
his Body after having been dragg'd about the Streets by the Rabble, was at
laſt torn in Pieces.</p>
               <p>If thou would'ſt know, how the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Luines</hi> obtain'd the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour, it was by Ingratitude.
For, when he and his Brother were firſt brought to <hi>Court,</hi> they were
both ſo poor, that they had but one Cloak between 'em; and for that Reaſon
could not go abroad together. Yet being recommended to the <hi>King</hi> by a
certain <hi>Nobleman</hi> for excellent <hi>Falkners,</hi> they were received
into Favour. But they<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104896:45"/>abus'd the Kindneſs of their Patron;
and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating malicious Things into the <hi>King's</hi> Ear, againſt the
<hi>Nobleman</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> cauſed him to be baniſh'd from
the <hi>Court.</hi> After which they managed all Things.</p>
               <p>Then ſucceeded <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> in the Chief
<hi>Miniſtry;</hi> of whom I have ſaid a great Deal in my Former Letters to
the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> and thou wilt find them in the
<hi>Regiſter.</hi> I will now add, what I never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; That he
was very Ambitious to be thought a good Judg of <hi>Verſe.</hi> He gave to
one <hi>Poet,</hi> for a Witty Conceit on his <hi>Coat</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi>
Two Thouſand <hi>Sequins,</hi> tho' 'twas but a <hi>Verſe</hi> of <hi>Seven
Words.</hi> Another he promoted to an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Dignity,</hi> worth
a Thouſand a Year, for comparing him to the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi> But he
cauſed a Third to be kick'd out of Doors, for his Obſtinacy in denying to
alter a Word of his <hi>Poem,</hi> which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> diſliked.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Miniſter</hi> was very Revengeful, and amongſt
other Effects of his Temper, none was more taken Notice of, or reflected on,
than the Death of <hi>Monſieur de Thou,</hi> whom the <hi>Cardinal</hi> cut
off for no other Reaſon, but becauſe his Father in a <hi>General
Hiſtory</hi> which he wrote, had repreſented one of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s
<hi>Anceſtors,</hi> under a very Ignominious and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Figure. That
<hi>Hiſtorian</hi> was the Renowned <hi>Thuanus,</hi> of whom, I ſuppoſe,
thou haſt heard.</p>
               <p>As to King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. himſelf, he was eſteemed a
great Diſſembler; accuſtomed to<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104896:46"/>careſs thoſe with
more than ordinary Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whom he deſigned ſuddenly to ruine: Whence
it grew to a <hi>Proverb</hi> in his Time at the <hi>French Court,</hi> when
they ſaw any <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſmil'd on, to ſay, <hi>His Buſineſs
is done.</hi> It cannot be denied that this <hi>Prince</hi> had a Great Spirit,
and ſome Wiſdom; yet he was obſerved to take Delight in many petty
Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unbecoming <hi>Royal Majeſty.</hi> He would ſpend much of his Time
in <hi>Painting,</hi> and ſend for the moſt Famous <hi>Maſters</hi> in
that <hi>Art,</hi> to view his <hi>Works.</hi> An equal Inclination he ſhewed
to <hi>Muſick.</hi> And ſometimes he was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be thought a good
<hi>Cook.</hi> Once he made a Great <hi>Paſty</hi> with his own Hands,
fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with <hi>Veniſon</hi> only fit for the Mouths of <hi>Infidels,
viz.</hi> The Fleſh of <hi>Dogs, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes,</hi> with other
Abominable Animals, of which it is not lawful for a <hi>True Believer</hi> to
taſte. This he cauſed to be ſerved up to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a <hi>Feaſt</hi>
which he made to ſome of his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> who to Honour the
<hi>King</hi>'s Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, eat greedily of the Horrid Diſh, and highly
praiſed his Skill; whilſt he diverted himſelf with laughing at them. He
had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch Freaks as theſe, which render'd him Contemptible and
Ridiculous to the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> In a Word, he was

lately in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> which has put all <hi>France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a
great Conſternation, aſtoniſh'd every Body, and encreaſed the
Thoughtfulneſs of the Wiſe. The Firſt Effects of it were felt by the
Inhabitants of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> which are certain Mountains dividing
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> There it did great Miſchief, overwhelming
ſome <hi>Medicinal</hi> Baths, many Houſes, and deſtroying Hundreds of
People. Only one <hi>Moſque</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> which ſunk into the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns below, was thrown up again, and ſtands very Firm, but in another
Place. This is look'd upon as a great Miracle, eſpecially by the

their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; in regard this <hi>Church</hi> has been diſputed
between them and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> each <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> claiming Right

is unconteſtably decided; For 'tis removed by this Convulſion of the

<hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Witches.</hi> I am perſuaded, that this <hi>Globe</hi> 
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:104896:47"/>is much more Ancient than the Generality of Mankind imagine
it to be: That it has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone various Changes by the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Fire
and Water: And that it is now haſtening towards another Revolution. I believe
the <hi>Central</hi> Fire has eaten its Way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the Surface, and
kindled all the Mines of Sulphur, and other Inflammable Matter, which it meets
with in its Circular Aſcent. Theſe corroding and daily conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their
own Vaults, approaching alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too near the vaſt Receptacles of
Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Waters which lie nearer the Surface, over-heat thoſe Lakes;
which being thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified into Vapours, and pent up in the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the
<hi>Globe,</hi> ſtrive to break forth with Immenſe Violence, which cauſes
that Heaving and Rocking of the <hi>Superficies,</hi> that ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
Mortals. But then the Cauſe is very deep and far from us. For where the
Surface is ſhallow, in ſuch Paſſions of the <hi>Globe,</hi> the Earth
commonly breaks and tumbles in, with whatſoever is upon it. Nay, whole Cities
ſometimes have been thus ſwallowed up. And the Danger is eaſily
fore-known by a ſhort Snatching and Trepidation of the Ground, Houſes,
Trees, Men and every Thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Reach; for then the Convulſion is
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Fatal. But where the Motion is Heavy, Grave and Regular, 'tis a Sign
that both the Source and the Danger of it are far off. And this is ſo much
the more Evident, by how much farther the <hi>Earthquake</hi> is felt above
Ground. For the nearer any ſuch Paſſion<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104896:48"/>happens to the
Center, it muſt be granted, that its Force is extended the wider on the
Circumference. This depends on a <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Demonſtration, and
there needs no more be ſaid to thee who art Conſummate in the
<hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I eſteem a due Reflection on this is, That tho' there be
no Peril in theſe Remote <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> yet we know not how ſoon
they will come nearer to us, neither can we be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, where or when they
will happen, or how far they will reach. It follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a Natural
Conſequence, That ſince theſe Things are Unavoidable, and all the Wit of
Man cannot invent a Means to eſcape ſinking into the Bowels of the Earth
where it breaks in; we ought to be careleſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different what Death we
die, and only be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to live like Men, that is, according to
Reaſon. For whether our Souls ſurvive or no, 'twill be comfortable to
expire in Peace, and full of our own Innocence.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HERE is now like to be a great Change at this <hi>Court.
Cardinal Mazarini</hi> is dead. He died at the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the
<hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vincien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> on the 9th. of this <hi>Moon,</hi>
having been ſick a long Time. There happened a great Fire at the
<hi>Louvre</hi> (ſo they call the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> in this
City) about Five Weeks ago,<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104896:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>which obliged the
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> who log'd there at that Time, to remove to his own Houſe.
From whence, for the Sake of Air, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by his
<hi>Phyſicians</hi> to go to the aforeſaid <hi>Caſtle.</hi> But all in
vain: For <hi>Death,</hi> which finds Acceſs into the ſtrongeſt
Fortreſſes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him thither, and led him in Triumph to the
<hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulneſs,</hi> who had made
ſo great a Noiſe and Buſtle in this our <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that a certain <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> foretold
him, he ſhould die in this <hi>Moon.</hi> But the <hi>Cardinal</hi> gave no
Credit to him: Tho' one would think he had ſome Reaſon to believe him in
this, for the Sake of a Former Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his, concerning the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Beaufort.</hi> I have mentioned this <hi>Prince,</hi> and the Enmity
that was between <hi>Mazarini</hi> and him, which occaſioned the
<hi>Duke</hi>'s Impriſonment in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> of
<hi>Vinciennes.</hi> During his Reſtraint, the fore-mentioned
<hi>Aſtrologer</hi> gave it out in <hi>Paris,</hi> That the <hi>Duke</hi>
ſhould eſcape out of Priſon preciſely on ſuch a Day. The
<hi>Cardinal</hi> being informed of this, waited till the Day came, deſigning
to puniſh the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer</hi> as a Cheat, or at leaſt to expoſe
him for an Ignorant Perſon. To which End he ſent for him, and upbraiding
him with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Folly, in that the Day was now come, and yet the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was ſtill a Priſoner, without any Hopes,
or ſcarce a Poſſibility of eſcaping, order'd him to be ſent to the
<hi>Baſtile.</hi> But the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> addreſſing himſelf with
much Submiſſion and Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104896:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpoke to
this Effect: <hi>May it pleaſe your Eminence only to reſpite my Sentence
till to Morrow, and then hang me if you do not find that I have ſpoke Truth.
The Day which I foretold, is come indeed, but it is not paſt. A Courtier will
ſoon convince you, that I have not ſtudied this Science in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> mov'd with theſe Words, only confin'd
the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> in a Chamber of his own <hi>Palace.</hi> And the next
Day he receiv'd an <hi>Expreſs,</hi> which gave him an Account of the
<hi>Duke</hi>'s Eſcape, and the Manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That on the Day
before, he had let himſelf down by a Ladder of Ropes into the
<hi>Caſtle</hi>-Ditch, and was no more to be ſeen or heard of. Thus the
<hi>Aſtrologer</hi> eſcap'd the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>'s Revenge, and got much
Fame at the <hi>Court,</hi> which was encreas'd by the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s
Death, falling out exactly according to his Prediction.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Miniſter</hi> was a very ſubtle Man; and
<hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> us'd to ſay of him, <hi>That if he were minded to
put a Trick on the Devil, he would only ſet</hi> Mazarini <hi>to Work.</hi>
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made him his Confident, inſtructed him in all the Secrets of
the <hi>French Court,</hi> the Art of Government, and on his Death-Bed
recommended him to the <hi>King,</hi> as the fitteſt Man to ſucceed him in
the Management of the <hi>Publick.</hi> He was after the Death of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. at firſt oppoſed by ſeveral <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees;</hi> but
the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Authority, and that of the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Conde</hi> ſupported him: Whence aroſe a Common <hi>Proverb</hi> in
thoſe Days, <hi>The<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104896:50"/>Queen permits All, the Cardinal
Commands All, and the Prince puts All in Execution:</hi> For this laſt had
then the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Miniſter</hi> was not eſteem'd ſo Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous as
his <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> yet he heap'd up Vaſt Treaſures; Part of
which he beſtow'd in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Buildings and Furniture, the Reſt he
ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> to his Father; who aſtoniſh'd at the Prodigious
Quantities of Gold he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, us'd to ſay, <hi>Sure it rains Money in</hi>
France. However, he made himſelf Odious to the <hi>Subjects</hi> of this
<hi>Nation</hi> by his Continual Oppreſſions; and they are glad he is
gone.</p>
               <p>'Tis a By-Word at <hi>Rome,</hi> when any <hi>Pope</hi> dies, to
ſay, <hi>Now the Dog is dead, all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is buried with him.</hi> But I
doubt, it will not prove true in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi> at this
Juncture. For the <hi>King</hi> will either find a <hi>Miniſter</hi> Equal in
Subtlety to the Deceas'd <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who ſhall ſupply his Place; or
he will take the Adminiſtration of Affairs into his own Hands. Be it which
Way it will, we are like to ſee the ſame <hi>Maxims</hi> purſu'd, ſo
long as <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs</hi> are in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who
firſt taught this <hi>Crown</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand its own Strength.</p>

               <p>I Have ſent a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to the <hi>Mufti</hi>
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with the Death of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Mazarini, Firſt
Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and the Greateſt <hi>Favourite</hi> that
ever liv'd. Now I will inform thee of ſome Paſſages, which I omitted in
my Letter to that Venerable <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> It is Neceſſary for me thus
to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute my Intelligence, with a due reſpect to the different
<hi>Quality</hi> of my <hi>Superiours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou, I ſuppoſe, wilt require ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his
Diſpoſition and Morals, with ſuch a Character as may render this Great
<hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> familiar to thy Knowledge.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed to place his chief Happineſs in aggrandizing his
<hi>Maſter</hi> whom he ſerv'd with a Zeal ſo pure and diſintereſs'd;
a Loyalty ſo Incorruptible, and by ſuch regular Methods of Prudence and
Policy; as if in his Days, nothing were to be counted Vertue or Vice, but what
either favour'd or oppos'd the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>'s Intereſt.
He was of a Happy Conſtitution for a <hi>Courtier,</hi> being by Nature
Debonair, Complaiſant, Affable, and of a Sweet Deportment. Yet Experience and
Art, taught him to improve theſe Advantages, to the Height of
Diſſimulation. You ſhould ſee Courteſie and extraordinary Goodneſs
flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every Feature of his Face; You <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104896:51"/>ſhould hear
Words breathing from his Mouth, like the ſoft Benedictions of an
<hi>Angel:</hi> Yet at the ſame Time, his Heart gave the Lye to Both. He
meant nothing leſs, than that a Man ſhould find him as good as his Word. He
was ever ready to promiſe any Thing that was demanded of him: But in
Performance, ſlow and full of Excuſes. Frugal of his <hi>Prince</hi>'s
Money, and Liberal of his own. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in his Buildings, and the Furniture
belonging to them: Aiming in <hi>all</hi> Things to exceed other Men, his
<hi>Equals;</hi> and in <hi>ſome,</hi> to ſurpaſs even Mighty
<hi>Princes,</hi> his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. In a Word, he was accompliſh'd with all
Qualifications requiſite in a Fortunate <hi>Courtier,</hi> and a good
<hi>Stateſman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet after all, this Sublime <hi>Genius</hi> yielded to
<hi>Death:</hi> But not like <hi>Common Mortals.</hi> He died altogether like
<hi>himſelf,</hi> without ſo much as changing that ſettled Gravity, and
Serene Air of his Face, as had been Remarkable dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life. He made the
<hi>King</hi> Heir of his Eſtate, and bequeathed abundance of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>To ſay all in Brief: If he was Great in his <hi>Life,</hi> he
was much more ſo in his <hi>Death;</hi> mingling his laſt Breath with the
Sighs and Tears of the <hi>King,</hi> who lamented his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the
Mourning of a <hi>Son</hi> for a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

               <p>YEſterday a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> came to my Hand from a very
Remote Part of the Earth Our Couſin <hi>Iſouf</hi> ſent it from
<hi>Aſtracan,</hi> a Famous City for Traffick, formerly belonging to the
<hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> but now in the Poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Moſcovites.</hi> He has been there a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, finding Profit
by Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: For, there is a vaſt Reſort to that City from <hi>China,
Indoſtan, Perſia, Moſcovy,</hi> and other <hi>Provinces</hi> of
<hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Roads to it, are daily covered with
the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans</hi> of Trading People. And the River <hi>Volga</hi> can
hardly ſuſtain the Innumerable Multitude of Veſſels that Tranſport
Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with their Goods backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, between
<hi>Aſtracan,</hi> and the <hi>Regions</hi> round about the <hi>Caſpian
Sea,</hi> into which that Mighty River diſcharges it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſouf</hi> is Ingenious, and has pitch'd upon ſome
Advantageous Way of enriching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which tempts him to take up his Abode
in that City, and there end his Travels; or at leaſt, he will repoſe
himſelf there, till For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune preſents him with a fairer Opportunity of
encreaſing his Wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:104896:52"/>In the mean Time, I perceive by his Letter,
that he gets Money apace, lives very happily, and has the Wit to keep himſelf
free from the Yoke of Marriage, which embaraſs'd him ſo much formerly. He
ſoon put that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Wife out of his Mind, after he had Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd
her; and he never fail'd to gratify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with new Amours, where-ever he
came in his Travels. He writes very Comically; and I can't forbear ſmiling,
when he tells me, He has had as many <hi>Concubines</hi> as the <hi>Grand
Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</hi> By which thou wilt perceive, That <hi>Iſouf</hi> is much
addicted to Gallantry. He frankly confeſſes, That he firſt learned this
Mode of loving at large in <hi>Perſia,</hi> eſpecially at
<hi>Iſpahan;</hi> where he ſays, 'tis a Mark of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for a Man to be
good at Intriguing with the Ladies: And he is call'd a <hi>Turk</hi> by way of
Diſgrace, who frequents not every Evening the <hi>Gardens</hi> and
<hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in the Suburbs. But he adds, that in
<hi>India</hi> the Liberty of courting Women is much greater. And that the very
Nature of that <hi>Climate,</hi> diſpoſes a Man to this ſoft Paſſion.
In a word, our Amorous Kinſman retains the ſame Humour ſtill.</p>
               <p>Yet this does not hinder him from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his
neceſſary Affairs with Diligence, and Alacrity. He diſpatch'd a
Buſineſs for me at <hi>Archangel</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and another
at <hi>Moſco,</hi> very dexterouſly. Which convinces me, that he is not
leſs Sedulous and Careful in Things which concern himſelf. He ſays, the
<hi>Moſcovites</hi> are the greateſt <hi>Drunkards</hi> in the 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104896:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>World. Their Chief and moſt beloved Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is
what the <hi>French</hi> call, <hi>The Water of Life.</hi> 'Tis a Chymical
Drink, extracted from the Lees of Wine, or other Strong Beverages: ſuch as
thou know'ſt is common among the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and
<hi>Franks</hi> in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> When the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are
once got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Houſe where this <hi>Nectar</hi> is Sold, and are a little
warm'd and elevated with it, they will not depart till all their Money's is
gone: Nay, they will pawn their very Garments from their Backs in a Frolick,
rather than want their Doſe of this Inebriating Stuff, and go out ſtark
Naked in the Coldeſt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is, fall aſleep in the open Streets, and
yet are ne'er the worſe for it when they wake, but go to their daily Work
with the greater Ardour. For, 'tis only the Common People are guilty of this
Extravagance. As for the Gentry and Nobility, they are more cloſe and
reſerv'd in their drunken Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> according to the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he gives
me of them, are a very rude and unpoliſh'd People; Surly to one another, and
extremely rugged to Strangers. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all other <hi>Nations</hi> in
the World, and ſay, 'tis impoſſible for any Man to go to <hi>Heaven,</hi>
who has not a <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Soul in him. They profeſs the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of the <hi>Greek Church;</hi>
but now they have ſeparated themſelves, and ſet up a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>
of their own, to whom ſo great a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is paid, that the
<hi>Emperour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104896:53"/>holds his Stirrop when he

               <p>WE are apt to admire ſome Strange Paſſages which we find
Recorded in <hi>Ancient Hiſtory,</hi> and whoſe Truch is out of the Reach
of any Mortal to prove: Yet we ſlight the Miracles which are before our Eyes,
Evident Matters of Fact, which no body can contradict. Whence this ſhould
proceed, I know not, unleſs it be from a Natural Kind of Drowſineſs in
the <hi>Soul,</hi> Common to the greateſt Part of Men; like the Sleep of
thoſe, who cannot ſo ſoon be awaken'd by the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Noiſes they are
accuſtom'd to, as by the ſoft and ſtill <hi>Idea's</hi> of a ſtrange
<hi>Dream;</hi> So we regard not the Things to which we are daily habituated,
tho' in themſelves never ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: Whilſt we ſtart and are amaz'd
at the moſt Ordinary Relations of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> only becauſe they are
Novel to us, and we were not Eye-Witneſſes of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>I formerly ſent a Letter to <hi>Cara Hali,</hi> the
<hi>Sultan</hi>'s <hi>Phyſician,</hi> wherein I mentioned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Phyſicians</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who in paſt Ages, were Eminent for
ſome Remarkable Cures. But, I tell thee, not one of them could match the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>'s Succeſs in Curing an <hi>Epidemical</hi>
Diſtemper, which they call the<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104896:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>KING's
EVIL.</hi> The General <hi>Symptoms</hi> of this <hi>Malady,</hi> are certain
Swellings in the Face, Neck, or other Parts of the Body; ſometimes
accompanied with Blindneſs, Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Lameneſs, and other Imperfections.
Thoſe who are troubled with this <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> flock to the
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Court</hi> at certain Seaſons of the Year, and being
introduced into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he only touches the Part affected with his
Hand, and an Infallible Cure follows.</p>
               <p>They ſay, this Gift has been Inherent in the <hi>Kings</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> for many Generations: And the <hi>Prieſts</hi> magnify it as
a Great <hi>Miracle.</hi> But, I tell thee, all the Prodigy in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
lies in the Strength of the People's Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which thou knoweſt works
half the Cure in many Diſtempers. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſtand by the
<hi>King,</hi> whilſt he touches the Sick: They repeat their,
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> and uſe certain <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Exorciſms,</hi>
being veſted all in White like <hi>Magicians.</hi> Theſe
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> are perform'd with abundance of Gravity, which ſtrikes an
Awe into the Credulous Patients. And to render the Buſineſs yet more
Myſterious; whereas other <hi>Phyſicians</hi> take Money of the Sick, this
Royal <hi>AEſculapius</hi> beſtows a Piece of Gold on every one whom he
touches, which they are obliged to wear about their Necks as long as they live.
Now whether the <hi>Charm</hi> lies in the <hi>Gold,</hi> or the
<hi>King</hi>'s Touch, or the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> or final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Patients <hi>Fancy,</hi> it matters not
much. This is certain, That Thouſands who come to the <hi>King</hi>'s Feet,
very much diſorder'd by this<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104896:55"/>
                  <hi>Evil,</hi> find a
ſenſible Alteration in their Bodies, before they depart from his
Preſence; and in a few Hours or Days at moſt, are perfectly recover'd.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have ſome
<hi>Magical</hi> or <hi>Phyſical</hi> Tincture in their <hi>Blood.</hi> Or,
it may be, they have found out the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi>'s <hi>Stone,</hi>
ſo much talk'd of; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it down to their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> as a
Part of the <hi>Royal Inheritance.</hi> Which enables the preſent
<hi>King,</hi> to do ſo many Prodigious Things both at <hi>Home</hi> and
<hi>Abroad,</hi> in <hi>Peace</hi> and in <hi>War,</hi> beſides his Part in
Curing this Sickneſs. I am no <hi>Roſicrucian,</hi> nor very fond or
credulous of <hi>Miracles;</hi> yet I often wonder at the <hi>Treaſures</hi>
of this <hi>Monarch,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Inexhauſtible. But the Ways of
<hi>Kings</hi> are ſecret, and he of <hi>France</hi> is ſingular in his
Myſterious Methods of growing Rich and Great. Neither do all his Magnificent
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, ſeem to diminiſh his Wealth. The <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Sueden</hi> has been his <hi>Penſioner</hi> ever ſince he began to
Reign: And Millions of <hi>French</hi> Gold, are diſperſed among the

in the Cares of this Vain World, and the more Particular Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of

               <p>Oh that it were Lawful for me to ſhake off the Fretting Yoke,
and diſintangle my ſelf from the Snares of Humane Policy! That I might live
like the Men of the <hi>Firſt Ages,</hi> who honour'd the <hi>Earth</hi> as

the Air without Fear of the <hi>Fowler;</hi> neither did any Yawling Huntſman
rouze the Timorous Hare from her Seat. The Roes and the Hinds could ſcamper

for Sanctuary; neither did any ſly Angler tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan the Fiſh of the Rivers.
As for the Sea, 'twas then Unknown; No Man as yet, had ventur'd on that

               <p>MY Buſineſs in this Place obliges me to keep Company with

Stateſmen, Souldiers, Courtiers, Prieſts, Fidlers, Mechanicks, Seamen, or
Perſons of any Profeſſion, from whom I can hope for any Improvement: For,
there is hardly ſo deſpicable a Fellow in the World, who may not teach an
Inquiſitive Mind ſomething, to which it was a Stranger before.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I converſe with <hi>Painters,</hi> whom I generally
find to be Men of Wit and Senſe, but very lewd and diſſolute: However,
they ſerve to divert my Melancholy, to which thou knoweſt I am much

               <p>It was an odd Whim of <hi>Martin Heemskirk,</hi> a Famous
Painter, that was born at a Village of the ſame Name. He died in the Year of
the <hi>Chriſtians Hegira,</hi> 1574. This Man had amaſs'd together in his
Life Time a Vaſt Quantity of Money; and having no Wife or Children, nor other
Relations of his own to leave it to, he was reſolv'd to do ſomething, for
which he might be talk'd of after his Death. I have heard of many dying Men,
that have had one Caprice or other in making their laſt <hi>Will</hi> and
<hi>Teſtament:</hi> But thou wilt ſay this of <hi>Martin</hi>'s was
Singular. For, on his Death-bed he bequeath'd all his Wealth to be
diſtributed into Equal <hi>Dowries</hi> or <hi>Portions,</hi> wherewith to
marry a certain Number of <hi>Maids</hi> of <hi>Heemskirk,</hi> his

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:104896:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>It is neceſſary for thee to know,
that ſince his Death, there has been a great Alteration of <hi>Religion</hi>
in thoſe <hi>Parts:</hi> The Inhabitants, which in his Time were <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> are now all <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And at the Time of this
Change or Reformation, as they call it, it was the General Practice of the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to demoliſh all <hi>Images</hi> and
<hi>Croſſes</hi> where-ever they found 'em. Now it was the Cuſtom of the
<hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to ſet up a <hi>Croſs</hi> at the End of every
<hi>Sepulchre</hi> of the <hi>Dead.</hi> Yet, ſo great a Veneration have the
<hi>Heemskirkers</hi> for the Memory of this <hi>Painter,</hi> that whereas
there is not a <hi>Croſs</hi> to be ſeen ſtanding in all the Country
beſides; yet his, being of Braſs, remains untouch'd, as the only
<hi>Title</hi> their <hi>Daughters</hi> can ſhew to his <hi>Legacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas a more Cruel and Inhumane Caprice of an <hi>Italian
Painter</hi> (I think his Name was <hi>Giotto</hi>) who deſigning to draw a
<hi>Crucifix</hi> to the Life, wheadl'd a poor Man to ſuffer himſelf to be
bound to a <hi>Croſs</hi> for an Hour, at the End of which he ſhou'd be
releas'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and receive a Conſiderable Gratuity for his Pains. But,
inſtead of this, as ſoon as he had him faſt on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> he
ſtabb'd him Dead, and then fell to drawing. He was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd the Greateſt
<hi>Maſter</hi> in all <hi>Italy</hi> at that Time. And having this
Advantage, of a Dead Man hanging on a <hi>Croſs</hi> before him, there's no
Queſtion, but he made a Matchleſs Piece of Work on't.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had finiſh'd his <hi>Picture,</hi> he carried
it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was aſtoniſh'd, as<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104896:59"/>at a
Prodigy of Art, highly extolling the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſiteneſs of the Features and
Limbs, the Languiſhing, Pale Deadneſs of the Face, the Unaffected Sinking
of the Head: In a Word, he had drawn to the Life, not only that Privation of
Senſe, and Motion which we call Death; but alſo the very Want of the
leaſt Vital Symptom.</p>
               <p>This is better underſtood, than expreſs'd. Every Body knows
that it is a Maſter-piece to repreſent a Paſſion, or a Thought well and
naturally. Much greater is it to deſcribe the total Abſence of theſe
Interiour Faculties, ſo as to diſtinguiſh the Figure of a Dead Man, from
one that is only aſleep.</p>
               <p>Yet all this and much more, cou'd the <hi>Pope</hi> diſcern in
the Admirable <hi>Draught</hi> which <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otto</hi> preſented him. And he
lik'd it ſo well, that he reſolved to place it over the <hi>Altar</hi> of
his own <hi>Chappel:</hi> For, thou know'ſt, this is the Practice of the
<hi>Nazarenes,</hi> to Adore <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> and <hi>Images. Giotto</hi>
told him, Since he lik'd the <hi>Copy</hi> ſo well, he wou'd ſhew him the
<hi>Original</hi> if he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>What doſt thou mean by the <hi>Original,</hi> ſaid the
<hi>Pope?</hi> wilt thou ſhew me <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> on the
<hi>Croſs</hi> in his own Perſon? No, repli'd <hi>Giotto,</hi> but I'll
ſhew your <hi>Holineſs</hi> the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> from whence I drew this,
if you will abſolve me from all Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The good old <hi>Father</hi> ſuſpecting ſomething
extraordinary by the <hi>Painters</hi> thus Capitular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, promis'd on
his Word to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him. Which <hi>Giotto</hi> believing, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104896:60"/>told him where it was: And attending him to the Place, as
ſoon as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, he drew a Curtain back, which hung before the
Dead Man on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and told the <hi>Pope</hi> what he had
done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Holy Father</hi> extremely troubl'd at ſo Inhumane and
Barbarous an Action, repeal'd his Promiſe, and told the <hi>Painter,</hi> he
ſhould ſurely be put to an Exemplary Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giotto</hi> ſeeming reſigned to the <hi>Sentence</hi>
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd upon him, only begg'd leave to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Picture</hi>
before he dy'd; which was granted him. In the mean while, a Guard was ſet
upon him to prevent his Eſcape. As ſoon as the <hi>Pope</hi> had caus'd the
<hi>Picture</hi> to be deliver'd into his Hands, he takes a Bruſh; and
dipping it in a Sort of Stuff he had ready for that Purpoſe, daubs the
<hi>Picture</hi> all over with it, ſo that nothing cou'd now be ſeen of the
<hi>Crucifix:</hi> But it was quite effac'd in all outward Appearance.</p>
               <p>This made the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtark mad: He ſtamp'd, foam'd
and rav'd like one in a Phren'ſy. He ſwore the <hi>Painter</hi> ſhould
ſuffer the moſt Cruel Death that cou'd be invented, unleſs he drew
another full as good as the former: For if but the leaſt Grace was
miſſing, he wou'd not pardon him. But if he cou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an exact
Parallel, he wou'd not only give him his Life, but an Ample Reward in
Money.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Painter,</hi> as he had Reaſon, deſir'd this under
the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Signet,</hi> that he might not be in Danger of a Second
Repeal: Which<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104896:60"/>was granted him. And then he took a wet
Sponge, and wip'd off all the <hi>Varniſh</hi> he had daub'd on the
<hi>Picture.</hi> And the <hi>Crucifix</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the ſame in all
Reſpects, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> who looked on this as a great Secret, being
Ignorant of the Arts which <hi>Painters</hi> uſe, was raviſhed at the
ſtrange <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis.</hi> And to reward the <hi>Painter</hi>'s
treble Ingenuity, he abſolv'd him from all his Sins, and the Puniſhments
due to them; ordering moreover his <hi>Steward,</hi> to cover the
<hi>Picture</hi> all over with Gold, as a farther Gratuity for the
<hi>Painter.</hi> And, they ſay, this <hi>Crucifix</hi> is the Original by
which the moſt famous <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> are drawn.</p>
               <p>I need make no other Reflection on this, Than that as the
Suppos'd Murder of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the Source of
all the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Devotion;</hi> ſo the real <hi>Homicide</hi> which
this <hi>Painter</hi> committed, has made it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and fervent, by
how much the <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes</hi> drawn after this <hi>Pattern,</hi> excel all
that were ſeen before them, in the <hi>Tragical</hi> Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the
<hi>Martyr'd Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, from this Reaſon it is, that <hi>Painters</hi> are in
ſo great eſteem among the <hi>Italians,</hi> becauſe they form the
<hi>Gods</hi> which thoſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> Adore. It is no wonder
therefore, that the <hi>Chief Head</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould ſo
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Abſolve <hi>Murder</hi> in a <hi>Painter,</hi> as a <hi>Venial</hi>
Sin, eſpecially when it is done <hi>in Ordine ad Deum,</hi> as the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſay, that is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>God</hi>'s Glory, as the
<hi>Pope</hi> eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104896:61"/>himſelf this was:
Since <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the main Engine which ſupports the State and

is a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> or at leaſt, the Crafty

               <p>My Friend, thou and I have ſeen enough of their Tricks and
Holy Frauds in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Praiſe be to <hi>God,</hi> they had not Power

               <p>THIS <hi>Court</hi> is now at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and all
ſeems to be diſſolv'd in Joy for the Birth of a <hi>Dauphin.</hi> The
<hi>Queen</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of this Young <hi>Prince,</hi> on the Firſt Day
of this <hi>Moon.</hi> There's Nothing but Feaſting, Dancing and Revelling on
this Account, with Bonefires and Congratulatory Addreſſes. Only the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Brother has little
Reaſon to be over-merry, ſince he was the next Preſumptive <hi>Heir</hi>
of the <hi>Crown,</hi> in Caſe the <hi>King</hi> died without Iſſue Male:
For the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>France</hi> exclude a <hi>Female</hi> from
Reigning. Yet, this <hi>Duke</hi> diſſembles his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grief, for being
thus put by his Hopes, and appears as Joyful as the <hi>Father</hi> himſelf,
He huggs and admires the <hi>Royal</hi> Babe, wiſhing him Health and Long
Life in a Compliment, whom he really could rather wiſh out of the World; or
at leaſt, that he had never come into it. So violent are the Temptations to a
<hi>Crown,</hi> ſo ſtrong the Deſire of <hi>Empire,</hi> That the
Nearneſs of <hi>Relation,</hi> which endears the Reſt of Mortals one to
another, enranges the Hearts of <hi>Princes</hi> from thoſe of their own
<hi>Blood,</hi> if they ſtand in the Way of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. And I can
aſſure thee, the <hi>French</hi> do<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104896:62"/>not ſpare to
ſay, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this Vice to
attempt great Things, were not his <hi>Genius</hi> over-aw'd, by the
Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fortune and Spirit of his Brother.</p>
               <p>Neither is the <hi>King himſelf</hi> Inſenſible of this;
remembring with what Warmth the <hi>Duke</hi> received the Flattering
Addreſſes of ſome <hi>Courtiers,</hi> during his Brother's dangerous
Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> had well-nigh given him over for a
Dead Man.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted with this Paſſage but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by
<hi>Oſmin</hi> the <hi>Dwarf,</hi> who watches all the Motions of this
<hi>Court.</hi> He tells me that the <hi>King</hi> being inform'd, a Rumour was
whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered among the <hi>Grandees</hi> of his Death, cauſed them all to be
ſent for, and to paſs through his Chamber, whilſt the Curtains of his Bed
were drawn open, that they might ſee their <hi>Sovereign</hi> alive, tho' in
a bad State of Health. He ſays moreover, That the true Reaſon, why
ſeveral <hi>Lords</hi> of late have been removed from their <hi>Offices</hi>
about the <hi>King,</hi> is becauſe he reſented ill the too early and
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Court they made to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> on
the Report of his Brother's Death. 'Tis natural to all Men to love
themſelves, and to deſire the Diſpoſal of their own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. No Man
would be content to have his <hi>Eſtate</hi> given away by his Servants, at
their own Diſcretion. And <hi>Sovereign Monarchs</hi> are the moſt Jealous
of all Men in ſuch Caſes: Particularly, the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> is known to be a <hi>Prince</hi> very ſenſible of his
Honour, and ſoon touched in that Point, by the leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104896:62"/>of Diſ-reſpect in his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and of
Encroachment in his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he is a
<hi>Prince</hi> of no great Character, either as a Souldier, or a Stateſman.
Neither has he been much talked of in the World, till the Beginning of this
Year, when he Married an <hi>Engliſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> by Name
<hi>Henrietta,</hi> Daughter to the late Murder'd <hi>King</hi> of that
<hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have had another <hi>Match</hi> here alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
late <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Daughter, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Toſcany.</hi> Theſe things oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion various Diſcourſe among
thoſe who pretend to weigh exactly the different Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of
<hi>Chriſtian Courts,</hi> eſpecially of ſuch as are concerned in the New
<hi>Alliances.</hi> For, the Greateſt <hi>Monarchs</hi> here in the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> marry only for Profit and Advantage, to Fortify themſelves
by a cloſer Union with the <hi>Houſe</hi> to which they are Ally'd. Whereas
our <hi>Eaſtern Princes</hi> only indulge their Paſſions in the Choice of
their Wives; admitting none to their Embraces, but the moſt Exquiſite
Beauties that can be found. And where they once pitch their Phancy, they
neither regard Riches, Honour, or any other Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ſave what their
Love ſuggeſts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Inexhauſtible Fountains of Wealth,
Nobility and good Fortune to all who have the Happineſs to be in their
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>They ſcorn to ſell themſelves, and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Glory
of their <hi>Diadems</hi> to a <hi>Foreign Prince,</hi> for the Sake of a
little Gold, and<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104896:63"/>much Trouble, with a proud Female, whom
perhaps they never ſaw. Yet this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice among the
<hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene Belief;</hi> Who conſider not, that
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Wife, a Partner of their <hi>Empire,</hi> and a Friend, they
often entertain a Snake, a Traytor, an Enemy: Eſpecially if ſhe be a Woman
of Wit and Intrigue, as moſt of them are. This made the now
<hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> the <hi>Relict</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII,
ſuſpected by her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and the preſent <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like Circumſtances: And it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be
ſo, where <hi>Princes</hi> Match themſelves after this manner, and cannot
debar their Wives from holding a ſecret Correſpondence with the
<hi>Family</hi> from which they Deſcend.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly, the <hi>Ottoman Politicks</hi> are the moſt
refined and ſecure of any in the World; our <hi>Religion</hi> moſt
<hi>Holy,</hi> and our <hi>Morals</hi> moſt <hi>Sound.</hi> Which Three are

<hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Am now in my Chamber by a Glowing Fire, wanting Nothing that
can comfort a Reaſonable Man: Whilſt I hear the Winds whiſtling, the Snow
driving upon my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and the hollow Voices of the <hi>Watch</hi>
proclaiming a Night little leſs Cold, than that <hi>laſting one</hi> they
feel in the <hi>Artick Circle</hi> once a Year. Yet I wiſh my ſelf in a
Plain, or on the Top of ſome High Mountain, where I might feel
<hi>Nature</hi> in the moſt Rigid of all her Humours. I love Variety, and
'tis a Pain to be confined to Pleaſure it ſelf, when 'tis all of one Kind,
or what I'm us'd to.</p>
               <p>'Tis to thee, my Dear <hi>Hali,</hi> I owe this Thought, when
you told me once, as we were walking together in the <hi>Cemetery</hi> of
<hi>Sultan So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>'s <hi>Moſque, That Man is made for all
Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember the Elegance and Force of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with which you
explained your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon a Loſs which I had then ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
<hi>Shipwrack;</hi> comforting me with this Reflection, that all the Gains on
Earth are only Burdens; all the Riches, Honours, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and whatſoever
is deſired by Mortals, are but ſo many Clogs to tie us faſter to this, 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104896:64"/>Little, Narrow <hi>Globe,</hi> where we are born to
trample on as our <hi>Foot-ſtool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is true; but I conſider farther, That the Occurrences
of this Life ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Indifference, and we ſhould be as
Chearful in a <hi>Priſon,</hi> as in a <hi>Palace;</hi> becauſe Nothing can
happen to us, which was not decreed by <hi>Fate.</hi> Methinks I could go as
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Torments in a Juſt Cauſe, as to a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Banquet. I could
ſmile at the Malice of my Perſecutors, and triumph o'er the Vain
<hi>Executioners,</hi> when I ſee them ſweat at their Inhumane Toil, and
yet can never have their Wills of a <hi>Soul</hi> caſt in ſuch a Mold as
mine. Whatever they may do with my Body, tho' they excruciate me with a
Thouſand Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cruelty, tho' they reduce me to Aſhes, yet they
cannot rob me of my <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fire, nor Sword, nor Rack, nor
any other Inſtrument of Barbarous Rage, can hurt my Thoughts. I ſhall
ſtill have the Power of Meditating, in Spight of 'em all: And I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
that the Specifick Happineſs of a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Creature. There's no
ſuch Thing as Pleaſure or Pain, but what our Opinion makes ſo. I have
try'd to handle Fire; I've graſped hot burning Coals in the Palm of my Hand,
with which I now write. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Element</hi> ſoon faſtened on my
Skin, and eat its way through into my Fleſh, whilſt I was buſy in
Contemplating its Nature and Effects, without being concern'd in any Senſe of
Pain. I kept a tite Rein, and curb'd my <hi>Soul.</hi> I held it within
Compaſs, and would<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104896:64"/>not ſuffer it to winch, or laſh,
or flounce out of it ſelf, or deſcend into my Body, to reſcue the Part
affected, or be concern'd at its Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. But when I reflect on the
Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that might follow, and that it would hinder me from ſerving
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> and my Friends, I threw the Coals away, well
ſatisfied that I had made the Experiment without prejudicing my Reaſon, or
falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Paſſion Unbecoming a Man.</p>
               <p>I take as much Pleaſure in Faſting, as in Eating or
Drinking; in Labour, as in Reſt; in Watching, as in Sleep. There's no
Exceſs or Contrariety in <hi>Nature,</hi> which does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me as much
Delight as Mediocrity, or the <hi>Golden Mean</hi> it ſelf. I find Guſt in
every Thing that happens to me. And this I take to be the Proper Part of a
<hi>Muſſulman,</hi> or of one <hi>Reſigned</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this hinders me not from buſtling in the World, and
proſecuting my Buſineſs with Alacrity and ſome Eagerneſs. We are born
for Action, and not wholly for Thought. 'Tis a mix'd Life we are to lead on
Earth. But when I fail of my End or deſired Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in any Undertaking, I
am not troubl'd, conſidering I was born to encounter Evil as well as Good in
this Mortal State.</p>
               <p>In all that I have ſaid. I do not pretend to the Celebrated
<hi>Apathy</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> I feel Pleaſure and Pain from the
ſame Objects which thus affects other Men: But I feel 'em with Indifference,
not ſuffering my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Judgment to participate with my
Paſſion and Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104896:65"/>I have perceived my ſelf ſometimes in
<hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> which I thought exactly anſwered the Character of thoſe
which dying Perſons feel. And I believe they were in a Degree the very
ſame: Yet I found no Panick Fears upon me, no Dread of that Amazing Change:
But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certain Blooming Hopes, Young, Tender Springing Joys, ariſing
from the Thoughts of a New Life, the Unavoidable Effect of that which we call
Death, wherein I promiſed my ſelf the Pleaſure of Freſh Enjoyments and
Diverſions, to which I was wholly then a Stranger.</p>
               <p>If thou thinkeſt this too Extravagant, and that Death is not a
proper Object of our Wiſhes, yet thou wilt at leaſt acknowledge, That it
may furniſh us with ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Content and Acquieſcence,
ſince no Man can avoid it, and it is ſure to entertain us with Novelties
which we never were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with before, which recommends it under a very
deſirable Figure, becauſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature perpetually covets New Things.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen Perſons Condemned to Death here in
<hi>Paris,</hi> who have been offer'd Life on certain Conditions not agreeing
with their Humour; yet have refuſed it, and rather choſe Death which they
knew would free 'em at once from all their Preſent Troubles. And thou
know'ſt with what Reſignation our Greateſt <hi>Baſſa's</hi> ſubmit
their Necks to the <hi>Executioners,</hi> when the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
thinks fit to call for their Lives. All that they reply to the <hi>Fatal
Mandate,</hi> is, <hi>The Will of my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104896:65"/>Lord be
done.</hi> They at once gather up all the Strength of their ſcattered
Reaſon, and ſhrink their dilated <hi>Souls</hi> to a Point. Then with a
Re-doubled Force, they ſhake off their Inclinations to Honours, Riches, and
the Pleaſures of this Life, as a Man rowzes from a long Dream or Trance. With
Smiles and a profound Submiſſion they kiſs the <hi>Royal Firme,</hi>
being awaken'd to the Thoughts of more illuſtrious and Serene Joys than this
groſs Earth affords, even to the Ineffable Pleaſures of <hi>Eden,</hi> the
ſure Reward of thoſe that die in Obedience and Peace: Since they are to be
eſteemed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as well as thoſe who meet Death in the Field of
the <hi>Sacred Combat,</hi> in the <hi>War</hi> for our <hi>Holy
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! That it were my Lot thus to expire in Honour, to have my
laſt Breath mixed with the Devout Aſpirations and Suffrages of <hi>True
Believers,</hi> that ſo my Example might edify others, and the Publick
Character of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted Loyalty might benefit my ſelf: Whilſt Fame
proclaimed it before my Arrival at the Inviſible <hi>Regions,</hi> to prepare
the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of Juſt Men to bid me welcome, and give me a kind
Reception, who am yet wholly a Stranger in thoſe Parts of the World: For
Death it ſelf cannot baniſh me out of the Univerſe. And there's my laſt
Comfort.</p>
               <p>Thou my dear <hi>Phyſician,</hi> wilt conclude, I'm Melancholy
by this Kind of Diſcourſe. But I tell thee, 'tis only another way of

<hi>Quality</hi> of the Perſons repreſented, and the Mode of the Age and
Country wherein they lived.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sort of Divertiſements, are very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable both to
the <hi>Court</hi> and the <hi>City.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> takes great Delight
in them, eſpecially in <hi>Ballets</hi> and <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> which
conſiſt chiefly of good Songs and Dances, mixed with bold and uncouth
Entries of <hi>Antiques,</hi> repreſenting <hi>Monſters</hi> and
<hi>Devils,</hi> as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſually deſcribe 'em.</p>
               <p>But there was lately a check given to their Sport, by an
Accident which has ſurpriz'd all People that hear of it, and has puzzl'd the
moſt Intelligent Heads to give an Account of ſo ſtrange an
Occurrence.</p>
               <p>On the 19th. of this <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and the
whole <hi>Court</hi> were preſent at a <hi>Ballet,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the
Grandeur of the <hi>French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> About the middle of the
Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was an <hi>Antique</hi> Dance performed by Twelve
<hi>Maſquerades,</hi> in the ſuppos'd <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Daemons.</hi>
But before they had advanced far in their <hi>Dance,</hi> they found an
<hi>Interloper</hi> amongſt 'em, who by encreaſing the Number to Thirteen,
put 'em quite out of their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: For they practiſe every Step and
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before-hand, till they are perfect. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104896:68"/>abaſh'd therefore at the unavoidable Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Thirteenth
<hi>Antique</hi> made 'em com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they ſtood ſtill like Fools, gazing at
one another: None daring to unmask, or ſpeak a word; for that would have put
all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators into a Diſorder and Confuſion. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Mazarini</hi> (who was the chief Contriver of theſe Entertainments, to divert
the <hi>King</hi> from more ſerious Thoughts) ſtood cloſe by the Young
<hi>Monarch,</hi> with a Scheme of the <hi>Ballet</hi> in his Hand. Knowing
therefore, that this <hi>Dance</hi> was to conſiſt but of Twelve
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> and taking Notice that there were actually Thirteen, at
Firſt imputed it to ſome Miſtake. But afterwards when he perceived the
Confuſion of the <hi>Dancers,</hi> and that they could not procced, he made a
more narrow Enquiry into the Cauſe of this Diſorder. To be brief, they
convinc'd the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> that it could be no Error of theirs, by a kind
of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, in that they had but Twelve <hi>Antique</hi> Dreſſes
of that Sort, which were made on purpoſe for this particular <hi>Ballet;</hi>
whereas the Thirteenth <hi>Dancer</hi> was diſguiz'd after the ſame manner.
Therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that either the <hi>Devil</hi> or ſome body
elſe, had put a Trick upon 'em. That which made it ſeem the greater
Myſtery was, that when they came behind the <hi>Scenes</hi> to uncaſe, and
examine the Matter, they found but Twelve <hi>Antiques,</hi> whereas on the
<hi>Stage</hi> there were Thirteen.</p>
               <p>The preciſer Sort of Bigots gave it out for certain, That the
<hi>Devil</hi> was amongſt 'em:<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104896:68"/>Whilſt others more
probably ſay, 'Twas only ſome Envious or Ambitious
<hi>Dancing-Maſter,</hi> who was either reſolv'd to be reveng'd for not
being one of the Twelve, or deſign'd to ſhew his Parts <hi>Incognito,</hi>
againſt another Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and in the <hi>Interim,</hi> ſet the
<hi>Court</hi> a wondring at his Singular Skill and Dexterity: For it was
obſerv'd, That one of the Thirteen far ſurpaſs'd all the Reſt, and did
Things to a Miracle.</p>
               <p>Be it how it will, it has brought to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a Paſſage that
happen'd on the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at a Town not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> about
Eighteen Years ago, yet was not half ſo much talk'd of then, as 'tis now:
Which was the Reaſon, I took no Notice of it in any of my Letters. But now
they are big with it: 'Tis the general Diſcourſe of all Companies, who make
Compariſons of that Event with this. Perhaps 'twill not be unpleaſant to
thee to know it.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1644. toward the latter End, a Company of
<hi>Stage-Players</hi> were at a Place call'd <hi>Vitry,</hi> entertaining the
People with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;</hi> But there happen'd ſomething really Tragical
to one of the <hi>Actors.</hi> This Man was to perform the Part of one
<hi>Dead,</hi> and then he was to revive again by <hi>Magick.</hi> He acted his
Part too truly, and baffl'd the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers</hi> Art. For when he touch'd
him with his <hi>Taliſman,</hi> as the Rules of the <hi>Play</hi> requir'd,
in Order to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Trunk</hi> could
not obey. The Man was <hi>Dead</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:104896:69"/>Whether he overſtrained himſelf in
imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Silent, Still, and Irrecoverable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of that Paſſive
State, and gave his ſlippery <hi>Soul</hi> a ſtrong Temptation, with a fair
Opportunity to eſcape its Bonds; Or, whether <hi>Heaven</hi> had a Particular
Hand in ſo Remarkable a <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> I will not preſume to
divine. But this and the other Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, has put the People quite out of
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with <hi>Plays.</hi>

               <p>Sage <hi>Hali,</hi> remember the <hi>Arabian Proverb,</hi> which
ſays, <hi>'Tis not good to Jeſt with God. Death or the Devil. For the

<hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>I had not been long in this City, before I ſent a Letter to
<hi>Bedredin, Superiour</hi> of the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi> of <hi>Cogni</hi> in
<hi>Natolia,</hi> whoſe <hi>Soul</hi> is now with <hi>God;</hi> wherein I
gave him an Account of the Converſe I once had with a <hi>Jeſuite.</hi>
For, pretending to be a <hi>Student</hi> and <hi>Retainer</hi> to the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> I cou'd not avoid the Company of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks:</hi>
Beſides, It was my Intereſt to inſinuate into their Acquaintance; and to
tell the Truth, I have made it a great Part of my Buſineſs to gain a
Familiarity with <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Derviſes</hi> ever ſince I
came hither.</p>
               <p>There was Abundance of Reaſon for this, on ſeveral Accounts.
For I improv'd my ſelf much by the Society of thoſe amongſt them that are
Learned; and I edify'd not a little by the very Ignorance and Follies of
others. From ſome I ſqueez'd out Secrets of <hi>State,</hi> and the
Deſigns of <hi>Cabals:</hi> By others I penetrated into the Myſterious
Vices of their own <hi>Order.</hi> In a Word, all of them taught me ſomething
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104896:71"/>or other which I knew not before; and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had
Occaſion to repent of keeping them Company.</p>
               <p>I contracted a particular Friendſhip with an Honeſt
<hi>Friar</hi> or Two in this City, who were Perſons of Candour and Learning:
But, now they are Dead. Beſides, I have had no ſmall Intimacy with
<hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Mazarini.</hi> I tell
thee, if I had not coveted the Friendſhip of theſe <hi>Princely
Prieſts,</hi> yet it had been impoſſible to eſcape their Knowledge, as
obſcure a Figure as I make. For, it was their conſtant Practice, thus to
ſeek out all the Strangers and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in this City, under Pretence of
that Great Regard they had for Men of Merit; but in Reality, to pump out of
them Foreign Secrets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> profeſs'd a great Kindneſs to me,
becauſe I had been at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and in other Parts of the

cannot divine; but I have Reaſon to think, he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected me for a

Proof, the Mark of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> Perhaps, 'twas an Effect of his
Good Nature, as being loath to ruin me Irrecoverably. But, I rather aſcribe
it to <hi>Providence,</hi> which wou'd not ſuffer him, it may be, to make
ſo Fatal a Reflection: Yet, by his Order ſome Years<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104896:72"/>ago, I was Impriſon'd for Six <hi>Moons.</hi> What the Meaning on't
was, I could never dive into. But, I had a ſhrewd Jealouſy of a certain
<hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Reſident at this <hi>Court,</hi> who perhaps might
do me ſome ill Offices. The World's like a Lottery, wherein we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to meet with many Unlucky Chances.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, thou wilt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That though
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> make a fair Semblance of Piety, Mortification, and other
<hi>Religious</hi> Vertues, yet they are great Buſy-Bodies, and wholly taken
up in <hi>Secular</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>If this were the Worſt Character they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they might
paſs for very Good Men, and neceſſary Inſtruments of the
<hi>Publick</hi> Welfare: Becauſe, they have the Tutelage and Guardianſhip
of all Men's Conſciences; they form 'em in their Youth, and govern 'em in
their Ripeſt Years. Beſides, they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantages of ſtudying the
<hi>Politicks,</hi> more than other Men, as being all Educated in the
<hi>Academies,</hi> where if they be not very dull, they cannot fail of
becoming good <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and Indifferent <hi>Stateſmen.</hi> For,
their <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> abound with all Manner of <hi>Ancient</hi> and
<hi>Modern Writers;</hi> and their Converſation is generally refin'd and
pregnant in Intrigues.</p>
               <p>But they corrupt their Learning, with falſe <hi>Maxims</hi>
which they borrow from an Intolerable Pride and Senſuality; perſwading
themſelves, that they are as far above other Men, that is, the
<hi>Laity,</hi> as thoſe are above the <hi>Beaſts;</hi> That <hi>God</hi>
has beſtow'd on them a<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104896:72"/>
                  <hi>Dignity</hi> Superiour to that
of the Greateſt Temporal <hi>Monarchs;</hi> and, in fine, That this
<hi>Earth</hi> is a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and themſelves the <hi>Gods</hi> and
<hi>Lords</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak at this Rate of the <hi>Nazarene Prieſts,</hi>
underſtand me not without Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There are ſome Good and Holy Men
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them Perſons of Unblemiſh'd Manners, and Incorrupt Sincerity.
But, theſe are very rare; and the <hi>French Prieſts</hi> are eſteem'd
the moſt ſincere of any within the <hi>Pale</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Italian Clergy,</hi> they are mere
<hi>Libertines;</hi> the moſt debauch'd and profligate Fellows in the
World.</p>

                  <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> a late Private <hi>Agent</hi>
of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who had travell'd up and down through all
<hi>Italy,</hi> and reſided a conſiderable Time in the Chief Cities and
Towns of Note, made many curious Obſervations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the
<hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which he ſet down in his

Pleaſure; and believe 'twill not be unwelcome to thee, to give thee an
Abſtract of what he ſays.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible, he may exaggerate ſome Things, and deliver
himſelf too partially in others, out of the Natural and Inherent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
the <hi>Jews</hi> have for the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104896:73"/>thou wilt find, that in the Main, he inſiſts only on ſuch
Reflections as it becomes any Man to make, who has the leaſt Spark of Common
<hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Firſt Place, he finds Fault with the

Sacrament</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> Whilſt they
indulge themſelves at the ſame Time in all Manner of Laſciviouſneſs,
wallowing in Fornication, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Inceſt, and Sodomy it ſelf. He ſays,
there is hardly one <hi>Prieſt</hi> in Ten, who does not keep Two or Three
Harlots; and the moſt Recluſe <hi>Derviſes,</hi> are either Pimps to
other Men's Luſts, or they indulge their own with the moſt infamous
<hi>Courtezans</hi> and <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</hi> Theſe Pretenders to Perfection
and Sanctity; are often found Maſquerading and Revelling about the Streets,
in the Time of <hi>Carnaval,</hi> with a Company of Whores for their
Attendance. Nay, all the Year round their <hi>Monaſteries</hi> are no other
than <hi>Stews</hi> or <hi>Brothel-Houſes.</hi> They introduce Women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their <hi>Cells</hi> in a <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Habit, and ſo they paſs for
Men who come to viſit them as Friends, Relations or Travellers. Theſe
<hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> lie thus conceal'd for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days and
Nights together. And the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> of the <hi>Convent</hi> winks at
this for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Money, being moſt commonly as bad as any of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> go marching and ſlouching along
the Streets, in the moſt Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104896:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>Manner
Imaginable. You wou'd take 'em for perfect <hi>Santones</hi> and
<hi>Ideots.</hi> Yet this is all but <hi>Mummery,</hi> whilſt they are the
moſt glozing <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the World, mere <hi>Devils</hi> in a
City, and abounding in wicked Thoughts and Practices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adonai</hi> tells a pleaſant Story of a young
<hi>Monaſtick</hi> of St. <hi>Dominick</hi>'s Order at <hi>Rome.</hi> This
<hi>Monk</hi> was no <hi>Noble</hi> Extraction, and his Parents were very rich,
and powerful in the City. On which Account he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd many Liberties,
deny'd to the reſt of his <hi>Religeous</hi> Brethren. He was permitted to
carry good Quantities of Gold and Silver about him, for his Perſonal
Expences; and to wear a <hi>Secular</hi> Habit, ſuitable to his Birth and
Quality. But this Liberty had like to have prov'd fatal to him one Night during
the <hi>Carnaval.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was late, and very dark, when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Bully was
beating the Streets, upon the Hunt for Whores; and walking under certain
<hi>Piazza's</hi> near the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> he was accoſted by a Woman
mask'd, and in a very good Dreſs; who ſpoke to him frankly, asking him the
Way to <hi>Il Rotundo.</hi> This is the Name of a <hi>Church</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> dedicated to <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Saints:</hi> In the Time of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 'twas call'd <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or the <hi>Temple</hi>
of all the <hi>Gods.</hi> The <hi>Monk</hi> being in one of his Rambling
Equipages, and his Inclinations equally bent on Pleaſure; having alſo a
Hundred Florins about him; preſently made Anſwer, He wou'd conduct her to
the Place<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104896:74"/>ſhe enquired for. She, after ſome
counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Eſſays of a modeſt Repulſe, at length accepted his Offer:
And by the Way, he perſwaded her into a Tavern. The cunning <hi>Nymph</hi>
manag'd her Buſineſs ſo well, that the <hi>Monk</hi> over-heated with
Wine, and other coſtly Entertainments, grew ſo in Love with her, that he
forgot ſhe was to go to the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and offer'd to wait on her
home. She accepted the Motion; and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, her Houſe was ſeated on
the Banks of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> they return'd the ſame Way as they came.</p>
               <p>When they arriv'd at the <hi>Piazza's,</hi> where they firſt
met, Three Perſons appear'd, muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled up in Cloaks: Two of which ſuddenly
ſeiz'd the <hi>Monk,</hi> holding their Ponyards at his Breaſt; whilſt
the Third, diſcloſing the hidden Light of a Dark Lanthorn, which he held in
his Hand, faſten'd on the Lady, and made her unmask. As ſoon as he ſaw
her Face, he ſtamp'd and rav'd, menac'd and ſwore, he wou'd be the Death of
that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain who had debauch'd his Wife. All this was but a fore-laid
Deſign. In a Word, Af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter all the Parts of an abus'd, incens'd, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vengeful
Husband, acted to the Life; at laſt through the Interceſſion of the Two
other <hi>Ruffians,</hi> and the <hi>Monk</hi>'s penitent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
Addreſs, it was concluded to ſpare his Life and only ſtrip him naked;
leaving him in that Condition to ſeek his Fortune among the
<hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104896:74"/>This was ſoon put in Execution, and the
Free-booters, with all their Prey, ſecurely march'd off. The poor
<hi>Monk,</hi> thus miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abandon'd, without Garments, Money, or any
Thing to comfort him in his Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to bribe the <hi>Watch,</hi> gave
himſelf over to Melancholy and Deſpair, in regard this Accident would bring
an Eternal Infamy on him, and he ſhou'd be no longer able to ſhew his Face
in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of his Nativity; nor among any of his Kindred and
Friends. Sometimes he thought to drown himſelf in the <hi>Tyber;</hi> or
elſe to counterfeit a Phrenſy, and ſo run bawling, driveling, and talking
Nonſenſe through the Streets; hoping the reſt wou'd never be
divulg'd.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was in theſe penſive Thoughts, irreſolute what
to do, the <hi>Watch</hi> walking their Rounds, bolted upon him on a ſudden;
and ſeeing a naked Man, at that Time of Night, in ſuch a ſolitary Place,
at firſt were ſtartl'd, as tho' they had met a <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> but
recollecting themſelves better, they boldly ſeiz'd his Perſon, and
examin'd how he came in that Condition.</p>
               <p>It was in vain for him to beg, entreat, and promiſe any Thing,
if they wou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to open Shame. This did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their
Curioſity and Suſpicion. In a Word, the Place of their Rendezvous being
very near the ſame Tavern where this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Monk</hi> had regal'd
his Strumpet, they led him thither, and kept him Priſoner till the Morning.
He that kept the Houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104896:75"/>his Face again; and
knowing that the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had a ſecret Enmity
againſt the <hi>Monk,</hi> and all his Race, ſent him private Intelligence
of this Adventure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging him to take this Opportunity of Revenge;
hinting withal, That he need not take notice, that he knew the <hi>Monk,</hi>
but only puniſh him as an ordinary Fellow, breaking the Laws of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Governour,</hi> glad of this Occaſion; when the
<hi>Monk</hi> was brought before him, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be whip'd through the
very Street, where his <hi>Monaſtery</hi> ſtood. This was done accordingly;
and as he paſs'd by the Gate, his Brethren, ſeeing him in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
ruſh'd out, and reſcu'd him from the Executioner's Hands; breathing Revenge
againſt the <hi>Governour,</hi> and all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in putting this
Diſhonour on their <hi>Houſe,</hi> and the whole <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt be forc'd to break off, before I have inform'd thee of

               <p>THE <hi>French King</hi>'s <hi>Genius</hi> ſeems alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
bent on <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Politick Affairs;</hi> and tho' he allows
ſome Moments to his <hi>Love,</hi> yet the greateſt Part of his Time is
conſecrated to the Neceſſary Affairs of <hi>State,</hi> and to the
Improvement of <hi>Military</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. This has been his Courſe ever
ſince the Death of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini.</hi> That <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi>
whilſt he was living, endeavoured No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo earneſtly as to divert the
Young <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> from minding Buſineſs, by <hi>Plays, Ballets</hi>
and other ſoft Entertainments. But as ſoon as he was dead, the
<hi>King</hi> began by Degrees to forſake his Youthful Recreations, and look
into the Affairs of his <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Bold Stroke of <hi>Regal</hi> Authority which he
gave, was the Suppreſſing the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant</hi> of the
<hi>Finances,</hi> a very Ancient <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but much
abus'd of late by thoſe who have enjoy'd it. For, having the Management of
the <hi>Royal Revenues,</hi> it has been found out, That they embezzel'd them
to their own private Uſes, purchaſing Houſes, Caſtles, Towns and the
faireſt Eſtates in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> for them and their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>The laſt in this <hi>Office,</hi> was the <hi>Sieur
Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet;</hi> who, beſides the waſte he made of the<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104896:76"/>
                  <hi>King</hi>'s Money in this Kind, was laying up an Extrordinary
Proviſion of Arms and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>Belle Iſle,</hi> a <hi>Sea-Port</hi>
of <hi>France:</hi> which gave the <hi>King</hi> ſo great a Suſpicion of
his ill Deſigns, That he went in Perſon after him as far as
<hi>Nantes;</hi> and being there farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of a private
Correſpondence held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Sieur Fouquet,</hi> and ſome
Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of <hi>Cardinal de Retz</hi>'s Party, he cauſed him to be
arreſted, and ſent Priſoner to the <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vinciennes:</hi>
From whence he has been ſince brought to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> This was
done in the 9th <hi>Moon</hi> of the laſt Year; and was the Occaſion of
erecting a New <hi>Chamber</hi> of Juſtice, to enquire into the Conduct of
thoſe who were employed by <hi>Fouquet</hi> in the Management of the
<hi>Finances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great Diſcoveries this <hi>Chamber</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made,
of the Cheats and Tricks practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe through whoſe Hands the
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Revenues</hi> have paſs'd, will, its thought, move the
<hi>King</hi> to eſtabliſh it as a perpetual and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Court</hi>
of <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> So that not the Value of an <hi>Aſper</hi> ſhall
henceforth be paid out of the <hi>Royal Treaſury,</hi> without the
Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Chamber.</hi> He has alſo retrenched many
ſuperfluous <hi>Offices</hi> in his Houſhold, that he may the more eaſily
ſupport the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thoſe that are Neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt better comprehend the Wiſdom of this
<hi>Prince,</hi> when thou ſhalt know, that he truſts Nothing abſolutely
to his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but pries into every Thing himſelf. He examins
Matters of the ſmalleſt Moment, as narrowly<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104896:76"/>as the
moſt Important Concerns. He makes daily Reformations among his
<hi>Domeſtick</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and New-Models both the <hi>Army</hi> and the
<hi>State.</hi> Which is alſo no ſmall Argument of his Courage, and the
Greatneſs of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in that he dares contradict the Methods of all his
<hi>Progenitors;</hi> take the <hi>Frame</hi> of this Mighty
<hi>Government,</hi> as it were to Pieces, and having mended every Thing that
was amiſs, join it together again; but after a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern wholly depending on
his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This has aſtoniſhed the Greateſt <hi>Stateſmen</hi>
of the Age, who conſider the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Undertaking, and yet cannot
find one falſe Step in his Meaſures. For whereas formerly, the
<hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> of the
<hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> with other
<hi>Grandees,</hi> have given frequent Trouble to the <hi>Kings</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom rais'd <hi>Civil War,</hi> when any Thing
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted them (ſo great was their Power, and ſo ſmall their
Dependance on the <hi>King:</hi>) This <hi>Monarch</hi> has, by a Happy Effect
of his Judgment and Reſolution, given ſo dextrous a Turn to the whole
<hi>Syſtem</hi> of the Publick, that the <hi>Princes</hi> find themſelves
more aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd than Ever; the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi>
perceive their Dignity encreas'd with New Luſtres, and the
<hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Stronger Hand over
their <hi>Subjects;</hi> yet all of them are reduc'd to an entire Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, not being in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ever to Rebel again.
Which is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Miracle of Policy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:104896:77"/>As he has thus gained the Point of his
<hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> at Home, and eſtabliſhed his Realm in the moſt perfect
<hi>Oeconomy</hi> that can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo he has recovered a particular
Honour Abroad, that till this Time has been always diſputed between the
<hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> from <hi>Sueden</hi>
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the <hi>Engliſh Court</hi> in the 10th. <hi>Moon</hi> of the
laſt Year: The <hi>French Embaſſador</hi> ſent his Coaches to honour
his Publick Entry, as is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual between Friends. But the <hi>Spaniſh
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> deſigning to affront the <hi>French,</hi> ſent his
Coaches alſo to attend the Ceremony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by his own Servants and a
Rabble of Idle Perſons whom he had hir'd on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe fell on the
<hi>French</hi> as they were paſſing along the Street, kill'd ſeveral of
them, and by Force ſtopp'd their Coaches, till thoſe of the <hi>Spaniſh
Embaſſador</hi> were got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; the Preheminence of Place being the
Chief Thing aim'd at.</p>
               <p>This was highly reſented at the <hi>French Court,</hi> and
every body thought that a freſh War would break out again between the Two
<hi>Nations</hi> on this Account. The angry Young <hi>Monarch</hi> commanded
the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> reſident here to depart the
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> and when another was ſent to ſupply his Place, the
<hi>King</hi> forbad him to enter his <hi>Dominions.</hi> Complaints were made
at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and all Things tended to a Rupture. Till at Length the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> having promiſed to make Satisfaction, his
<hi>Embaſſador</hi> war received at<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104896:77"/>this
<hi>Court,</hi> who aſſured the <hi>King,</hi> That his <hi>Maſter</hi>
diſavow'd the Action of his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and had
given expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all his <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> in <hi>Foreign
Courts,</hi> not to diſpute the Place with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> but to
yield it to the latter, where they ſhould both be preſent at the ſame
<hi>Entry.</hi> This was declar'd in the Preſence of Thirty <hi>Foreign
Miniſters</hi> reſiding at this <hi>Court.</hi> Which has rais'd a vaſt
Reputation to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> among all his Neighbours,
and ſtruck the greater Reverence into his <hi>Subjects</hi> at Home.</p>
               <p>In a word he is look'd upon as the moſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and every <hi>State</hi> courts his
Friendſhip. He gives the Law to the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> yet remains
himſelf Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and above Controul.</p>
               <p>How long his Affairs will continue at this Height, is known only
to <hi>God,</hi> who exalts and abaſes whom he pleaſes; who is the ſole
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of all Things, Reigning for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Shadow

               <head>LETTER XIV. To the Same.</head>
               <p>IT was late when I finiſh'd my other Letter, being the Hour of
the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Range, when the <hi>Infernal Spirits</hi> are permitted to
air them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper World.</hi> Methought I heard the
Clattering <hi>Eccho</hi> of the Gates of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which are ſhut
at that Seaſon to keep out the <hi>Daemons</hi> from entring and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Repoſe of the <hi>Bleſs'd.</hi> This made me conclude
ſo abruptly, leſt ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie <hi>Scribe</hi> of the <hi>Dark
Regions,</hi> ſhou'd have inſerted Evil in my Letter whilſt I were
aſleep. I recommended my ſelf to <hi>God,</hi> and went to Bed. After Two
Hours Reſt awaking, I perceiv'd by the Crowing of the <hi>Cocks,</hi> That
the <hi>Troops</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> were retir'd to their <hi>Den,</hi> chas'd
down by <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and the <hi>Guardian Conſtellations</hi> of the
<hi>South,</hi> and by the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Second Watch.</hi> Then I
aroſe, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully addreſs'd my ſelf to <hi>God,</hi> praiſing him
for the Succeſſive Benefits of Day and Night, and extolling his Magnificent
Works, with the exquiſite Order that he has eſtabliſh'd in the World.
Remembring alſo that I was a Man, and not born to ſleep, but to ſerve the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> and my Friends, I readily ſet Pen to Paper again, to
give thee a farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>French King</hi> and his
<hi>Court,</hi> with ſuch Occurrences as have happen'd of late.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:104896:78"/>This <hi>Monarch</hi> is very Singular in
his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Manner of Life; not brooking to be confin'd to the
<hi>Maxims</hi> of others, but ſquaring all his Actions by Rules of his own:
Yet 'tis difficult to find a Fault in his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He hears the Advice of
his <hi>Counſellors</hi> and Friends; and when they have done, he convinces
them in many Things, That they are under a Miſtake; which makes 'em ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Force of his Reaſon, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of his Wit, eſpecially when
they ſee the Events anſwering Expectation.</p>
               <p>Neither is he altogether ſo Intent on <hi>State</hi>-Matters,
but that he ſometimes gives himſelf the Diverſion of a Familiar
Diſcourſe with the moſt Ingenious <hi>Artiſts</hi> of all Sorts, who
find themſelves much improv'd by the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Invention, and the
Solidity of his Judgment in the <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> For he is an Excellent
<hi>Gun-Smith, Sword-Cutler, Armour-Maker,</hi> and every Thing that becomes a
<hi>King</hi> to profeſs.</p>
               <p>He is a good <hi>Architect</hi> alſo, and takes vaſt Delight
in <hi>Buildings,</hi> having laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of ſeveral Magnificent
<hi>Structures, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi> of a Noble Deſign, and intended to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the
moſt Polite and Glorious <hi>Fabricks,</hi> of Ancient <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Rome.</hi> For, I tell thee, this <hi>Monarch</hi> wou'd not willingly come
ſhort of any of the <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Beginning of this Year, he aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd his
<hi>Court,</hi> by a Promotion of Sixty Two <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Holy
Spirit.</hi> I have often mention'd this <hi>Order</hi> in my Letters to the 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104896:79"/>
                  <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port;</hi> and thou that
haſt beeen in <hi>France</hi> know'ſt, That 'tis the next Step to being
made <hi>Peer</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi> I ſhall only inform thee, that
during the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of this laſt <hi>Promotion,</hi> the
<hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> and <hi>Longueville</hi> had a Feud about
the <hi>Precedency,</hi> which at laſt was adjuſted in Favour of the
Former. In a Word, the <hi>King</hi> declar'd the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>Vendoſme</hi> to have a Right of <hi>Priority</hi> before all other
<hi>Princes,</hi> and to ſucceed in the <hi>Throne</hi> it ſelf, next after
the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is look'd upon as a Bold Effort of <hi>Royal</hi> Power,
and has ſtartled all the <hi>Court.</hi> No leſs ſurprized were they to
ſee the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reſign all his <hi>Eſtates</hi>
to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> reſerving only the
Poſſeſſion of 'em during his Life,</p>
               <p>And, now the <hi>King</hi> having weather'd the Point with all
his Enemies, both <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> ſtudies Nothing
more earneſtly, than to divert his <hi>Queen,</hi> and to let his
<hi>Subjects</hi> taſte the Sweets of <hi>Peace,</hi> the Effect of his
Matchleſs Fortune, to which even <hi>Crowned Heads</hi> find themſelves
compell'd to ſtoop and ſubmit.</p>
               <p>On the 5th. of the foregoing <hi>Moon,</hi> by his Appointment
was held a <hi>Tournament</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſel,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi>
call it. This is a Sort of Exerciſe on Horſe-Back, in Imitation of the
Ancient Manner of Fighting with Spear and Shield.</p>
               <p>The Place where they run, was raild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and Magnificent
<hi>Choiſcs</hi> erected for the<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104896:79"/>
                  <hi>Queen</hi> and
<hi>Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> to ſit in, as <hi>Spectators.</hi> The
Divertiſement was very Pompous; And the <hi>King</hi> was one of the
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants.</hi> The Reſt were the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>
the <hi>King</hi>'s Brother, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien</hi> Son to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guize.</hi> Each of theſe led a Troop of Horſe into
the Field. That of the <hi>King</hi>'s was habited after the Manner of the Old
<hi>Roman Knights.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s made a Figure
like the <hi>Perſians;</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>'s
repreſented the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>'s
Troop were in <hi>Indian</hi> Habits; and the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Guiſe</hi>'s appear'd like the <hi>Salvages</hi> of <hi>America.</hi> It
wou'd be too tedious to deſcribe the Particular Magnificences of each.
Suffice it to ſay, That they were all prodigiouſly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick and Rich in
their <hi>Equipage.</hi> The <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> alſo they made, were Brave
and full of Gallantry. But the <hi>Prize,</hi> which was a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond</hi> of
Great Value, was adjudged to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> by the
<hi>Queen-Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Former <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> loſt his
Life at this <hi>Royal</hi> Exerciſe, being run through the Eye into the
Brain by the Spear of an <hi>Engliſh Knight</hi> then at the <hi>French
Court,</hi> and one of the <hi>Combatants:</hi> For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the
Following <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> forbore to expoſe themſelves
to the like Danger. But this Young <hi>Mars</hi> fears nothing, being as
Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and Bold as was <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> the <hi>Trophies</hi> of
whoſe Victorious Combat with the <hi>Perſian Challenger</hi> at the Siege
of <hi>Babylon</hi> hang up in the <hi>Treaſury</hi> to this Day, as
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:104896:80"/>of his invincible Courage and Strength.
<hi>Sultan Achmet</hi> alſo took great Delight in throwing the Lance with his
<hi>Courtiers</hi> in the <hi>Atmeidan.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Sports</hi> fit
for <hi>Kings</hi> and Great <hi>Generals.</hi> And ſome of the <hi>Roman
Caeſars</hi> themſelves wou'd play the <hi>Gladiators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not lawful for me to cenſure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Actions
of my <hi>Sovereign.</hi> But I will tell thee what the <hi>French</hi> ſay
of him by Way of Contempt; <hi>That he never Combated in his own Perſon, with
any Thing but Timorous Hares and Hinds.</hi> It makes me bluſh to hear the
<hi>Great Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> thus blaſphem'd by the
Prophane Mouths of <hi>Infidels.</hi> And it were to be wiſh'd, he wou'd do
ſome ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Action, to raiſe himſelf another Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. I ſay
no more, but recommend thee to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>White Angel.</hi>

               <head>LETTER XV. To <hi>Zedi Alamanzi,</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> at
<hi>Venice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THOU haſt oblig'd me beyond my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, in that Ample
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of thy <hi>Life,</hi> which thy Letter contains. I eſteem
thee not the worſe, becauſe thou wert born of <hi>Chriſtian Parents;</hi>
but rather put the higher Value on thy Merit, in that being bred in
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Error, Thou haſt voluntarily embrac'd the Truth, without
any Proſpect of advancing thy Intereſt.</p>
               <p>When a Man of a <hi>Noble Stock,</hi> born to Riches and
Honours, bred in Softneſſes and Delights, and actually poſſeſs'd of a
fair E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſhall thus abandon his Country, his Relations, Friends and
Acquaintance, with all his Native Rights and Enjoyments, purely for the Love of
<hi>God,</hi> reſigning himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Will</hi> of
<hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and the Conduct of <hi>Providence,</hi> without
conſulting his own Eaſe and Delight in this World; 'tis an Evident Sign of
a Faithful Heart, and that his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity is without Stain.</p>
               <p>All this and much more, it ſeems, thou haſt done, and
therefore thou can'ſt not fail of being Happy in this World, and in
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:104896:81"/>I am extremely pleas'd in reading the
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Adventures of thy Youth, thy early In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to viſit
<hi>Foreign Countries,</hi> and thy Actual Travels through <hi>Europe,
Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> This is the only Way to learn true and
complete Wiſdom. For, a Man edifies a Thouſand Times more by his own
Perſonal Experience of Things, than by all the moſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<hi>Deſcriptions,</hi> that can be made by others. Beſides the Advantage of
becoming expert in the ſeveral <hi>Languages</hi> and <hi>Dialects</hi> of
the Earth; which he can never learn ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Books,</hi> as by
converſing with the Natives of each Country through which he paſſes.</p>
               <p>Beyond all this, there is an infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſeeing
the Variety of Objects, which every where expoſe themſelves to a
Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Eye. There is nothing more delightful to Humane Nature, than to try
all Things. Man is cloy'd with what is too Familiar to him. The moſt
Magnificent <hi>Palace,</hi> wou'd appear as a <hi>Priſon</hi> to him that
were always Confin'd to it. The Greateſt Fields, and moſt ſhady Groves,
wou'd afford us no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, if we had not Liberty to ſtraggle out of
them when we pleas'd. Man is <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> wild as other
<hi>Animals,</hi> and 'tis as bad as Death to be reſtrain'd of his Freedom. I
had rather at certain Seaſons, range in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, all over-run with
Weeds and Briars, than in the moſt Regular and Fragrant Garden in the World.
I would willingly chuſe the Fatigue of Climbing up a High, Steep, Crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Mountain, for the ſake of a new and larger<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104896:81"/>Proſpect;
before the Eaſe of walking always in a Low Valley, or Even Plain, tho' grac'd
with never ſo many Inviting Objects, which muſt always be the ſame: So
fulſom are the very Pleaſures we are daily accuſtomed to.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but that it was very agreeable to thee in thy
Journeys, when every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thou made'ſt from <hi>Stage</hi> to
<hi>Stage,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd thee Something Novel and freſh. A Man in ſuch
Caſes, is apt to think the Sun himſelf New, who has ſhined upon him from
his Nativity: The Air, the Earth, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, appear not the ſame Elements,
in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Places; or if our Reaſon convinces us their Nature is not
changed, yet we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em as Maſquerades, every Day in a New Dreſs:
Eſpecially when we go from one <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Climate</hi> to
another, the Strangeneſs of the Diſguiſe is heighten'd. So Infinite a
Variety preſents its ſelf to thoſe who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
               <p>But nothing affords a Man greater Delight, than to be familiarly
acquainted with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Habits, Laws, Cuſtoms, Manners, and Religions
of Mortals like himſelf. To ſee 'em in one Part of the World Adoring the
<hi>Sun,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhines on 'em but once a-Year, whilſt all the
Reſt of the Time they are ſhut up in Continual Darkneſs, very near being
ſtarv'd with Cold, and making hard ſhifts to live; in another to behold 'em
grimacing, and hear 'em curſing that Glorious <hi>Planet,</hi> becauſe he
is always to near 'em, rendring their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> Barren, drying up
their Water, and<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104896:82"/>ſcorching their Perſons almoſt to
Death; muſt needs be delightful to a Contemplative Man. And for ought we
know, the Laughter of <hi>Democritus</hi> might be the Reſult of as good
Thoughts as <hi>Heraclitus</hi>'s Tears. Who would not ſmile to ſee ſome
paying <hi>Divine</hi> Honours to the <hi>Scar-Crow</hi> of their Garden, to a
Tree, a Hog, a Dog or any Thing they firſt caſt their Eyes on in the
Morning as they do in <hi>Lapland?</hi> And yet who can forbear to weep, when
he ſees Men profeſſing to believe the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (who both preach'd up the <hi>Divine
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi>) pretending to the Pureſt <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, and
bred in the Study of the Sciences; worſhip Stocks and Stones, Pictures and
Images, Nails, Rags, Bones, Hairs, Bits of old Wood, or any Thing, that their
cunning Prieſt impoſe upon 'em as Adorable?</p>
               <p>Happy art thou, <hi>Zeidi,</hi> who art freed from theſe
<hi>Superſtitions</hi> of the <hi>Nazarenes;</hi> and Thrice Happy, in that
thou haſt chang'd 'em for the <hi>Faith</hi> unblemiſh'd, the

<hi>Practices</hi> of Sincere <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Thou
haſt not ſhun'd a Rock, to fall into a Quickſand, nor aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> to ſink into <hi>Atheiſm:</hi> But thou haſt eſcaped
from Narrow Gulphs and Streights, into a Free and Open Sea; from the Dark Fogs
and Miſts of Frozen <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to the bright <hi>Empire</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:104896:82"/>Since the Time that thou firſt

of <hi>Old Women, Fictions</hi> of <hi>Poets,</hi> or any <hi>Holy Frauds.</hi>
Thou perceiveſt nothing but Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down Integrity, in the Converſation of

deſerted, have a Thouſand Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Turnings, Foldings and Intricacies,
in their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi> So that it is almoſt as

way to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> through ſo many <hi>Meanders</hi> and
<hi>Mazes:</hi> They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a perfect Circle of Error and Vice.</p>
               <p>Praiſe be to <hi>God,</hi> who planted the <hi>Moon</hi> in
the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and cauſes the <hi>Stars</hi> to dart their
Refreſhing Rays by Night, Thou art happily delivered out of their Snares. Let
not thy Reſidence now among them, ever tempt thee to return to the
<hi>Religious</hi> Vanities of <hi>Holy</hi> Trifles, which have once made thee
Sick at the Heart. Remember, that thou beareſt in thy Body the Mark of a
<hi>True Believer,</hi> the <hi>Seal</hi> of a Great <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the
<hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> of a Profound <hi>Myſtery, Circumciſion,</hi> the
<hi>Emblem</hi> of <hi>Purity,</hi> by which thou art more enobl'd than by the
<hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Lord,</hi> thy <hi>Father,</hi> which
ſtreams in thy Veins. For now thou art incorporated into<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104896:83"/>the <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Lineage</hi> of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>
order'd the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of his <hi>Guards,</hi> to tell the
<hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio</hi> at this <hi>Court,</hi> That he muſt
forthwith depart the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> under the Conduct of Thirty Horſe.
This was performed accordingly, and the <hi>Nuncio</hi> was hurried away
immediately, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to ſpeak with any Perſon living,
ſave thoſe who were to accompany him to the Frontiers: And this
<hi>Order</hi> was publickly proclaimed in <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>King</hi>
alſo wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> demanding Satisfaction for ſo horrible an
Outrage, and caus'd <hi>Diſpatches</hi> to be ſent to all the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing them to contribute what lay in

him, proteſting that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Calamities which might follow, were not
to be laid to his Charge. This is a modeſt way of Threatning, us'd by
<hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> who do not always ſpeak in Thunder, like our
<hi>Eaſtern Monarchs</hi> when they menace War.</p>
               <p>I relate this as a Thing, which tho' it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of ſmall
Moment at the Beginning, yet its Conſequences may be great and extenſive,
if the <hi>French King</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould come to an open
Rupture. All the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> would find themſelves
engag'd on one Side or other. And we <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> might live to
ſee the whole State of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> disjoynted, alienated, and
embroil'd in Wars among themſelves; whereby they would lay their Countries
naked and open, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Arms of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> a

               <p>But 'tis thought the <hi>Holy Father</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> will
not farther provoke ſo daring and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a <hi>Monarch</hi> as him of

               <p>IN the Name of <hi>God,</hi> Benigne and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I approach the
Reſidence of great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, the Tremendous Solitude, the Cave bleſs'd
by frequent Viſitations of <hi>Angels,</hi> and by the former Preſence of
the moſt Sublime among Mortals, <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Legat</hi> of the
<hi>Eternal,</hi> the <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> of <hi>Alla, King</hi> of
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth. Alla!</hi> There is but One! Whoſe Name
reſounds through all the <hi>Orbs</hi> Above, when pronounc'd by the Faithful
Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> on <hi>Earth:</hi> And the
<hi>Eccho</hi> thereof from the Adamantine Gates of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
reaches the Abyſs of <hi>Hell,</hi> ſtriking the Infernal Spirits with
Horrour and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. They tremble at the Sound of the Dreadful Word,
which chains them up in their <hi>Priſons</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
Whereas had they Faith, they would rather rejoyce, believing, that the ſame
Word will one Day releaſe 'em from their Torments. For ſuch is the Clemency
of the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> as our <hi>Holy Doctors</hi> teach.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Mohammed,</hi> Friend of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> and
<hi>Tenant</hi> to his <hi>Prophet;</hi> I have experienc'd, that it is good
and wholeſome to begin every Thing we do or ſay, in the <hi>Name</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> Whoſoever does otherwiſe, either fails in the 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104896:86"/>Progreſs, or the End of his Deſign, and ſo remains
in Confuſion. <hi>Tagot</hi> creeps into his Enterprize, and through Malice
ſpoils it, robbing a Man of his Crown: Or <hi>Negidher,</hi> the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy,</hi> winds himſelf in, and entangles it: Or
<hi>Ablis,</hi> the <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> caſts a Damp on
it, and bereaves the Undertaker of his Joy. Such is the Fate of thoſe who
through Prophaneneſs, Sloth, or Contempt, forget to pay the due Veneration we
owe to the Author and Source of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and <hi>Good
Succeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not therefore think the Time mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent, which is taken
up in the Praiſes of <hi>Him</hi> who has neither <hi>Beginning</hi> nor
<hi>End, Father</hi> of all the <hi>Ganerations</hi> in this <hi>Viſible
World,</hi> and that <hi>Other</hi> which is conceal'd from Mortals. He is the
<hi>Governour</hi> of our Lives, and our ſole <hi>Patron</hi> in all
Neceſſities. Let us extoll and magnify his <hi>Attributes</hi> without
End.</p>
               <p>I am by Nature Contemplative, and Thoughtful; but I muſt needs
acknowledge, That I owe to my Education among the <hi>Muſſelmans</hi> the
Force of my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> The various turns of Fortune
and Experience, which I have had in the World, cou'd never yet blot out the
impreſſions of my Early Years, or diminiſh the Reverence I have for our
<hi>Holy Prophet.</hi> I often revolve in my Mind, the <hi>Series</hi> of
paſt Ages, and the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of former Times; the <hi>Origin</hi>
of <hi>Nations,</hi> and the Various <hi>Laws, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Wars</hi> and
<hi>Changes.</hi> I traverſe the<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104896:87"/>different
<hi>Epocha's</hi> of the Poſterity of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> comparing the <hi>Date</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s
Tranſmigration out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the Years of
<hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> and the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> In all of them I find great
Obſcurity, Contradiction and Doubtfulneſs, which puts me upon examining the
<hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> The
Antiquity of both is very great, and yet it comes far ſhort of the
<hi>Chineſe</hi> Chronology, and that of the <hi>Indian Bramins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I have tir'd my Soul with a vain Search of that which can

which almoſt demonſtrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, comparing this with the
<hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion,</hi> and that other of <hi>Ogyges:</hi> In a
Word, when I reflect on the numberleſs Incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are found in the

as much Reaſon for me to believe, That <hi>God</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately thus
dark'ned the Knowledge of Mortals, as that he confounded their
<hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> according to the Celebrated Relation of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> Whence it will be but loſt Labour for us who live in
theſe later Times, to ſeek for any Aſſurance or Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Truth
in Matters of ſo Remote and Early a <hi>Date.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore leaving every <hi>Nation</hi> to their own

<hi>Holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and of all the

               <p>Doubtleſs, that ſuperlatively <hi>Merciful</hi> and
<hi>Indulgent,</hi> connives at the Frailties of Mortals; He pities the
Invincible Ignorances of ſome, and the Fatal Neceſſities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He
knows the infinite Variety of our Bodily Conſtitutions, and the equally
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Bent of our Souls. He conſiders the Force of the Elements and
Climates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, and the unconquerable Influence of the Stars under
which we were Born. The whole Syſtem of Human Nature with its moſt hidden
Circumſtances, is expos'd to the Eyes of him who ſees All Things. 
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104896:88"/>He is no Stranger to the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of his own

Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with which he has endu'd 'em. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he damn any Man for an
Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Evil.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Mohammed,</hi> this is my Faith, my Hope, and my
Confidence. Otherwiſe I ſhould deſpair every Moment. If I am guilty of
Error and Preſumption, Correct me in thy Wiſdom. For, before thee, I am but

               <p>THE <hi>French</hi> have newly felt the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Joy,
whoſe Birth and Growth was like that of a Muſhroom, ſudden and ſwift,
the Product of a very little Time, and which ended in Mourning and Tears. The
Moon of <hi>November</hi> beheld a Daughter born to the Queen of
<hi>France:</hi> But that <hi>Planet</hi> had hardly carried the News through
all the Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Stars</hi> of

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:104896:88"/>before
ſhe was oblig'd to be the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of more ſad Tidings, and to
proclaim the Death of this Young Princeſs, to the <hi>Conſtellations</hi>
that aſſiſted at her Birth.</p>
               <p>In a Word: She was born on the 18th. of the 11th. Moon, and died
on the 30th. of the 12th. It looks as if ſhe only came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to be
a Witneſs of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> between her
Father, <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> XIV. and her Grandfather, <hi>Philip,</hi> the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and ſo return to the Region of <hi>Separate Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Peace</hi> was in General Terms ſign'd and ſeal'd
long ago, but there remain'd ſome Difficulties in adjuſting the Limits of
the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts, which were referr'd to the Management of
Commiſſioners on both Sides: And theſe, after they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the

<hi>Metz,</hi> at length finiſh'd their <hi>Negotiation</hi> on the 25th. of

               <p>This Royal Infant alſo liv'd to ſee <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> one

taken from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The King took Poſſeſſion of this
Important Place in his own Perſon, entring the Town on the 2d. of the laſt
Moon.</p>
               <p>'Tis look'd upon as a grand Overſight in the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> thus tamely to part with a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104896:89"/>which is inexpugnable be Land, and commands the <hi>Northern</hi>
Seas. But Money over-rules all other Conſiderations. And, it ſeems, the

               <p>There is lately a good Underſtanding eſtabliſh'd between

Letters one to another, and ſeem to be perfectly reconcil'd. To ſpeak the
Truth, this may be call'd the <hi>Pacifick</hi> Year among the Inhabitants of
<hi>Europe.</hi> For, excepting ſome Skirmiſhes and Bravado's of War
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> all the Reſt of
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is in Peace. And the <hi>Portugueze</hi> have ſo

<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> King, that what through his Aſſiſtance and the Aid of

worth. For, thoſe bold <hi>Africans</hi> will perpetually aſſault the
Town, and oblige the King of <hi>England</hi> to maintain a vaſt Gariſon in
it, beſides a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other Expences. This makes the

Two great and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Charges, a Daughter of the Royal Blood, and an Old

               <p>Illuſtrious Grandee, 'tis no ſmall Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the

to which I was formerly accuſtomed, my Salary is now augmented to the
Proportion of my Neceſſary Expences; Money is ſent me with a Liberal

Signior</hi> in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and farther unravel the Secrets of
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes.</hi> For ſo it often falls out, that a Man reaps
ſome Conſiderable Advantage from the Society of Travellers and Men of
Experience: And I had good Reaſon to hope for ſome Profit by this Man's
Acquaintance, who is thought worthy to be Courted by the <hi>Grandees</hi> of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I addreſs'd my ſelf to him with Abundance of
Ceremony and Regard; uſing alſo as much Diſſimulation as I thought
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conceal my ſelf and the Deſign I had in coveting his
Friendſhip. I ſeem'd a great Admirer of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> and
told him I was very ambitious to learn the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of that
<hi>Science</hi> from him, having heard his Skill highly commended not only by
Vulgar Fame, but by the Mouths of Men of Senſe and Quality, who gave him a
fair Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. I ſaid a great deal more to inſinuate my ſelf into his
good Opinion. But there being Company with him, he return'd my Compliments with
much Civility, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd me to come to him at a more convenient Seaſon,
and to leave my Name, that he might order his Servants to give me a kind
Reception at any Time, if he himſelf ſhou'd be out of the Way, becauſe it
was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſend many from the Door without introducing 'em. I told him my
Name was <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and that my Buſineſs at 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104896:91"/>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> was to ſtudy in the <hi>Academy,</hi> in
Order to my Preferment in the <hi>Church.</hi> When he had taken this down in
Writing, with the <hi>Hour</hi> and <hi>Minute</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Manner of <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> he begg'd me to excuſe the
Neceſſity he was under of returning to his Company; and ſo I took my
Leave.</p>
               <p>Not many Days after, I went to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, full of Hopes that I
ſhould benefit much by his Company. But as ſoon as he ſaw me, he
ſurpriz'd me with this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline"> "Sir, you have ventur'd much in coming to me:
For now 'tis in my Power, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you and your Buſineſs in this
City. But if I ſhou'd betray any Man, my Gift wou'd be taken from me. I am
neither a <hi>Follower</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
nor of any <hi>Sect</hi> that is now extant on Earth: But I adore the

it be what it will. And you that are not what you ſeem to be, ſhall receive
no more Hurt from me in this Place, than the <hi>Coadjutor</hi> of
<hi>Paris:</hi> For I am of no Party or Faction. All Men are equally my
Friends, who do me no Wrong, and every Place is my Home."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thou may'ſt imagine that I was in no ſmall Aſtoniſhment
at this Diſcourſe. But<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104896:91"/>recollecting my Spirits, and
conſidering it had always been my Opinion. That theſe
<hi>Fortune-Tellers</hi> deal by Confederacy; and ſuſpecting that my Name
being known to him ſo long before, it was not difficult for him to inform
himſelf ſomething of me; or that ſomebody of his Acquaintance who knew
me, had ſeen me go in and out from him, and ſo told him ſome of my
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; I made a Shew of going away diſſatisfy'd, ſaying,
<hi>It will be but loſt Time to hearken any longer to you: For I perceive you
know nothing of me, in telling me I'm not the Man I ſeem to be. No,</hi>
reply'd he, with an obliging Kind of Earneſtneſs, <hi>you are an</hi>
Arabian, <hi>and ſerve ſome Eaſtern Prince In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito.</hi> Then he went
on, and told me in a few Words ſome Former Paſſages of my Life. He hinted
at the Dangers I had been in, during my Reſidence at <hi>Paris;</hi>
mention'd my Captivity at <hi>Palermo,</hi> and the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter I had with my
old <hi>Sicilian</hi> Maſter. To be brief, he told me ſo many other Things
which I knew to be true of my ſelf, that I grew very uneaſie in his
Company, and yet durſt not depart from him of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, or ſhew any
Diſcontent. But muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together all the Diſſimulation and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
I cou'd, I turn'd the Diſcourſe to other Subjects; ſeeming very
Importunate to learn <hi>Aſtrology</hi> of him, and promiſing him a large
Gratuity, if he would teach me, I fairly took Leave, reſolving, if
poſſible, never to ſee him more,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:104896:92"/>Never was Man in greater Anxiety, than I
was when I came home to my Chamber, and ponder'd on what had paſs'd between
this Stranger and me. I am not Credulous of <hi>Miracles, Prophecies</hi> or
pretended <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> Yet I proteſt ſolemnly, I cou'd not

<hi>Divining,</hi> or at leaſt, that he was an excellent
<hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> Nay, to this Day I know not well what to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of
him. He may, for ought I know, be a <hi>Daemon</hi> Incarnate, or perhaps he is
a <hi>Magician.</hi> Sometimes I think one Thing, and ſometimes another. If
he performs theſe <hi>Prophetick</hi> Parts by Confederacy, ſtill I'm at a
Loſs how he ſhou'd come to know ſo much of me, who always thought my
ſelf the privateſt Man in <hi>Paris,</hi> and have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected no Methods
that were proper to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me ſuch in Truth. Then I ſuſpect my Old
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Maſter is one of this Man's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents, and has told
him ſome of my Circumſtances: For I have no Reaſon to be jealous of
<hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> It muſt be ſome ſuch Way, or elſe

               <head>LETTER XX. To the <hi>Captain Baſſa.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHAT I am going to relate wou'd ſeem Incredible to my ſelf,
and for that Reaſon I wou'd not give it any Room in a Letter to all the
diſcerning <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> were it not confirm'd
by Letters from ſeveral <hi>Merchants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> Parts of
<hi>Holland</hi> to their Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in this City. And they all agree,
That on the 9th. Day of the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> a Strange Man
was ſeen to float on the Sea near the Shore, being ſupported by a Piece of
Timber, on which he ſate with a Bottle of <hi>Strong Waters</hi> in his Hand.
Thoſe who firſt beheld this Spectacle, were Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſmall Boat;
and judging him to be the Relique of ſome Shipwreck (for there had been
Violent Tempeſts in thoſe Seas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Time) made up to him, and took
him into their Skiff. He expreſs'd his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for this Kindneſs, in the
beſt Manner he cou'd (for no Body underſtood his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.) And when he
was come aſhore, he fell on his Knees; and having lift up his Eyes and Hands
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he proſtrated himſelf, and kiſs'd the Earth. His
Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made of the Skins of Fiſhes, the Hair of his Head of a Flaxen
Colour, and he ſeem'd not to be Faint for Want of Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104896:93"/>Which made every one conclude, That he had kept up his
Spirits with that <hi>Chymicai</hi> Liquor in the Bottle, which was near half
emptied.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he ſaw the Riſing <hi>Moon,</hi> he fell on his
Face, and mutter'd certain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Words, knocking his Fore-head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Ground. Then he roſe and danc'd after a Wild Manner, ſinging pretty
Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Airs: And at every Stop, with his Right Hand extended, pointed to that
<hi>Planet,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing both in Tone and Actions much Devotion and
Love.</p>
               <p>Many Learned Men were ſent for, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this Stranger,
and if poſſible, by Signs or other Means to diſcover from whence he came,
and what Fate or Accident had thus abandon'd him to the Fury of the Winds and
Waves, to the Extremity of Hunger, Cold, and Watching; and to the devouring
Jaws of Sea-Monſters. But all their Efforts were unſucceſsful; They
ſpoke to him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, and he anſwer'd them, but ſtill in
a Dialect different from any of theirs, and altogether unknown. He ſeem'd to
ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Words in a Tone between whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ling and ſinging; which made ſome conclude, he was a
<hi>Chineſe,</hi> becauſe that People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce many of their Letters
after the ſame Manner So do the Inhabitants of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> and
<hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and Letters with them are as ſignificant as Words with the
<hi>Europeans.</hi> They ſhew'd him <hi>Globes,</hi> and <hi>Maps</hi> of the
World,<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104896:93"/>done by ſeveral Hands, and in various Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
with particular <hi>Charts</hi> of all the <hi>Maritine</hi> Regions on Earth.
But, to no other Purpoſe, than to excite his Devotion afreſh to the
<hi>Moon,</hi> whoſe Reſemblance he ſaw on ſome of thoſe Papers. He
wou'd ſmile at that Sight, kiſs his Fore-finger, and with a Religious
Complaiſance touch the Figure of that Planet: Then ſeeming to be in a
wonderful good Humour, he wou'd turn round and fall a dancing with his Arms
ſtretch'd, and turn'd in the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as thoſe who uſe
Caſtanets, or Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals. Singing all the while a Sort of inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Sounds,
but ſurprizingly Muſical and Sweet. So that No-body knew what to make of
him.</p>
               <p>He appear'd very temperate, modeſt, and reſign'd; refuſing
no Meats or Drinks that were offer'd him; yet neither eat nor drank to
Exceſs. Neither was he diſcontented at his Lodging, or any other Uſage;
though they tried to vex him ſeveral Ways, that they might ſee how he would
vent his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But he ſmiled at all, and ſubmitted patiently to
every Thing they impos'd on him.</p>
               <p>One thing was obſervable, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaw any Water,
he wou'd run to it immediately, and waſh himſelf, as well as he cou'd in
thoſe Circumſtances, never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting to ſprinkle ſome toward that
Part of the Heaven, where the <hi>Moon</hi> was viſible. And when they led
him into the Fields or Gardens, he wou'd crop the Graſs, and 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104896:94"/>Flowers, and with a compos'd Look wou'd throw them up in
the Air, adding ſuch Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Geſtures, as convinc'd every one, That he
did it in Honour of ſome <hi>Power</hi> above. Various were the Conjectures
of Men about him; ſome were of one Opinion, and others of a quite different.
No-Body cou'd poſitively conclude any Thing. Neither is it poſſible, as
I'm inform'd, for the Wiſeſt Men in thoſe Parts to find out this
Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he's ſuch another, as <hi>Imaum Rapibabet,</hi> a
<hi>Perſian</hi> Writer, mentions, who in the Year of the <hi>Hegira</hi>
502. was taken up by a Merchant-Ship of <hi>India,</hi> in the
<hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Babel-Mandel,</hi> pretending to be dumb, but capable
of Hearing, Writing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf ſeveral other Ways, if any
Body cou'd have underſtood his Language. At laſt he was found to be an
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> Slave, run away from his Maſter; an Ingenious Fellow, and
one that ſpoke all the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thoſe Parts; and therefore, that he
might be admir'd, wou'd be ſure to write in a Character of his own Invention,
which the greateſt Sages cou'd not read.</p>
               <p>Mighty <hi>Baſſa,</hi> thou encountereſt on that Element,
with ſtrange Monſters, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under no Name or Predicament that is

which I pray Heaven defend thee and me: For they infeſt both the Sea and

               <p>THE Term of our long mutual Silence, enjoyn'd us by our
Superiours, is now happily expir'd; and we have with good Succeſs, manag'd
our ſeparate Parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding any Cerreſpondence together. This was
only a Tryal of our Fidelity, Conduct, and Obedience: Or perhaps 'twas no more
than a Caprice of Policy, or a vain Whim of State. For, 'tis uſual with great
Men, thus to practiſe Experiments on thoſe whom they deſign to employ in
the moſt important Affairs. Whatever it be, we have acquitted our ſelves
like Truſty Slaves; and that's enough for us.</p>
               <p>This comes to thy Hand by an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant: One in
whom I confide. Here are Abundance of that Nation in <hi>Paris</hi> and other
Parts of <hi>France.</hi> They travel up and down from one Country and City to
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the Pretext of <hi>Trading;</hi> but are really <hi>Spies,</hi>
ſent from the Princes of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to obſerve the Counſels of
theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Courts, the Deſigns of <hi>Nazarene</hi> Monarchs,
and to take an exact Eſtimate of the Strength and Riches of theſe
<hi>Infidels.</hi> For, though they outwardly profeſs themſelves to be

               </p>
               <p>There is a Kind of <hi>Magick</hi> in Truth, which forcibly
carries the Mind along with it. Men readily embrace the Dictates of ſincere
Reaſon. Yet thoſe of thy Nation are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſhut their Eyes
wilfully againſt the very Light of Nature. You over-value your ſelves and

re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching us, that we are the Off-ſpring of <hi>Iſmael</hi> the Son of
<hi>Hagar,</hi> a Concubine and Slave. You conſider not that
<hi>Iſmael</hi> was the Eldeſt Son of that Glorious <hi>Patriarch;</hi> and
that by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> it is enacted, That the
<hi>Firſt-born</hi> Son ſhall inherit his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Patrimony, though he
were the Son of a baſe abject Slave, or hated Concubine. Did <hi>Moſes</hi>
make a Law contrary to that of his Fathers; Or, cou'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the
Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>God,</hi> do any thing contrary to the Divine Will? How then
cou'd he be guilty of diſinheriting <hi>Iſmael</hi> his Eldeſt Son, the

Father of many Princes and Noble Nations.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe therefore of thy Nation, ceaſe to boaſt of their
Pedigree, and exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104896:95"/>above the Victorious and
Triumphant <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> Children of a high <hi>Stock,</hi> a
<hi>Race</hi> wherein ſhines forth the Luſtre of the <hi>Ancient
Renown,</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Primogeniture:</hi> A
<hi>Lineage</hi> of Illuſtrious Honour, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd as the Leaves of the

Special Benediction of <hi>God.</hi> Whereas, thou knoweſt, the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> never made any great Figure on Earth, and are now reputed
no better than <hi>Vagabonds</hi> throughout the World.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Rabbi's</hi> reply to this, by owning that our Father
<hi>Iſmael</hi> was indeed a Great Prince; but that he was withal a
<hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Salvage</hi> Man, who ſupported his Nobility and
Grandeur by Rapine and Blood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling altogether in <hi>Deſarts</hi> and
unfrequented Places; robbing the <hi>Caravans</hi> of <hi>Merchants</hi> and
<hi>Travellers,</hi> oppreſſing the Poor, and murdering the Innocent. In
Fine, they give this Character of him, <hi>That his Hand was againſt every
Man, and every Man's Hand againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Accuſation they alſo add another, That the Princes
of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> who deſcend from <hi>Iſmael,</hi> have all along,
even to this Day, eſtabliſhed their Thrones in Cruelty, Maſſacres, and
Patricides. Fathers berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Children of the Lives they gave 'em; and
Children putting their Parents to Death: Brothers murdering Brothers, and
ſacrificing their neareſt Relations to the Maxims of a Barbarous Policy,
the Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104896:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>Suſpicions of State. And that

even on <hi>Iſmael</hi> and his Children, to this Day. But I would have thee,
<hi>Nathan,</hi> reflect impartially on Things, and ſuffer not thy Judgment
to be impoſed on by the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> of your <hi>Scribes.</hi> Look
back to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Written
Law, the Records of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the <hi>Seniors.</hi> There thou wilt
meet with frequent Examples of thoſe very Crimes which you lay to our Charge;
true Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels of the ſuppoſed Tyranny and Inhumane Actions, with which
you tax the unblemiſhed <hi>Iſmaelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did not your Father <hi>Jacob</hi> ſupplant his own eldeſt
Brother <hi>Eſau?</hi> Did he not cheat his Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> of his
Sheep? What was wanting to him of <hi>Iſmael's</hi> Valour and Fierceneſs,
he ſupplied with a <hi>Fox</hi>-like Craft and Subtilty. Yet, how often did

               </p>
               <p>When your Fathers came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what a Carnage did
<hi>Moſes</hi> their Leader com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, when he commanded the Sons of

at the Foot of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Three<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104896:96"/>and Twenty
Thouſand Men? Yet for the Sake of this deteſtable Tragedy he bleſs'd 'em,
ſaying, <hi>You have conſecrated your Hands this day in Blood, every Man in
the Blood of his Neighbour.</hi> Behold! the Original of your Prieſthood,
which is the Higheſt Rank of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remember how your Fathers almoſt cut off the whole Race of
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſo that there were not above <hi>Six Hundred</hi> Men of
that Tribe left alive. Forget not alſo, how <hi>Abimelech</hi> of the Tribe
of <hi>Menaſſe,</hi> got the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Maſſacring Seventy of his

               <head>LETTER XXII. To the ſame.</head>
               <p>I Concluded my other Letter ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, and
ſhort of my Deſign, being interrupted by a ſudden Deluge of Humours
overflowing my Eyes, accompanied with a Tempeſt in my Head, which at once
took from me the Power of thinking regularly, and of ſeeing how to Write. I
am often ſubject to theſe Weakneſſes of late, and to many other
Maladies. My Body ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays; Age and Care, Watching and Sickneſs,
with a Thouſand Caſualties beſide, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſſolv'd this
congeal'd Medly of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Methinks, I aw now no more than a poor
<hi>Skeleton,</hi> to which Nature and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, have left a dry wither'd Skin,
for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty's Sake, to cover its Nakedneſs; with a few evacuated Veins and
Arteries; ſhrunk Sinews, Tendons, Muſcles, and Cartilages, to tack this
Machine of Bones together, and keep it in Motion. In a Word, I ſeem to my
ſelf to be only a <hi>Hobgoblin</hi> or <hi>Ghoſt</hi> in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guize; I
cannot ſay, Incarnate, (for I've loſt all my Fleſh) but only bagg'd or
clouted up in the moſt contemptible Shreds, Rags, and antiquated Reliques of
Mortality, like a <hi>Maud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> or <hi>Scare-crow.</hi> I hang together by
Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:104896:97"/>Yet, ſuch as I am at theſe Years, I
ſtill poſſeſs at certain Seaſons more ſerene and vigorous Thoughts,
than in the Days of my Youth, when I was full of Marrow and good Blood. I can
feel my Soul ſometimes fluttering her Wings, and briskly ſhaking off the
heavy, ſlimy Cloggs of Earth, of Sleep, and of enchanted Life, or living
Death. She ſtruts and plumes herſelf, ſhe mounts aloft and glides in
Happy, though but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Foretaſtes of Eternal Bliſs. And then lur'd
down again by Charms of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd Eaſe and Pleaſure in the Fleſh,
ſhe comes to Hand at Call, and being hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd from the Radiant Light of
Heaven, ſhe tamely perches on the meaneſt ſenſual Appetite, which
eaſily conveys her to her wonted Darkneſs. This is the changeable State of
Mortals, and we muſt not expect a fixed Condition on this ſide the
<hi>Sepulcher.</hi> The Noble and the Vulgar are equally liable to theſe
Inconſtancies of Spirit; neither can the moſt exalted State of Sovereign
Monarchs, Privilege them from the common Frailties of Mankind. They are no
otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Meaneſt of their Slaves, than only by
the Vaſtneſs of their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their numerous Retinue, their
unlimited Power, and the vain Pageantry of external Honour.</p>
               <p>If we examine the <hi>Origin</hi> of Nobility, and Royal
Grandeur; if we trace the <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies</hi> of Princes and Potentates up to
their Fountain, we ſhall find the Firſt Fathers of 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104896:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe noiſy Pedigrees to be cruel Butchers of
Men, Oppreſſors, Tyrants, Perfidious Truce-breakers, Robbers, and
Parricides. In a Word, the moſt Primitive Nobility was no other than Potent
Wickedneſs, or dignified Impiety. And all the ſucceſſive Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it by Inheritance, Election, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, even to thoſe Modern Times;
are but ſo many Traducts of exorbitant Power and Honour, acquir'd and
propagated by the moſt enormous Vices, by Practices unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Men, and of
which the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are always aſham'd. Therefore they cover
their unjuſt Encroachments and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with the ſpecious Pretexts of
Juſtice and Vertue, calling that Conqueſt, which is no other than
down-right Robbery, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves Patrons of Mens Liberties
and Rights, Religion and Laws, whilſt in Effect they are the greateſt
Oppreſſors, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Atheiſts, and Out-laws in the World.</p>
               <p>This is not only true in the Race of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> of whom I made mention in my other Letter, but in all the
Families which have ever made any eminent Figure and Noiſe in the World.</p>
               <p>What were the <hi>Four</hi> renowned <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> but
ſo many Empires of <hi>Banditi,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of <hi>Free-booters,
Pyrates</hi> and <hi>Licens'd Thieves?</hi> As <hi>Diomedes</hi> told
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. 
<q rend="inline">"I, <hi>ſays he,</hi> becauſe I play the
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Corſair,</hi> and cruiſe up and down the Seas with one

                     <hi>Pyrate,</hi> Thou
that doſt the ſame Thing with a mighty Fleet, art call'd an
<hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> If thou wert alone and a <hi>Captive,</hi> as I am, they
wou'd eſteem thee no better than a <hi>Thief:</hi> And were I at the Head of
a numerous Army, as thou art, I ſhou'd be reverenc'd as an <hi>Emperour.</hi>
For as to the Juſtice of our Cauſe, there is no other Difference but this,
That thou doſt more Miſchief than I. Misfortune has compell'd me to be a
<hi>Thief,</hi> whereas nothing but an intolerable Pride, and inſatiable
Avarice puts thee upon the ſame Courſe of Life. If Fortune wou'd prove more
favourable to me, perhaps I might become better: Whereas, thy continual
Succeſſes make thee but the worſe."</q> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> admiring the
Boldneſs of the Man, and the Reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit, gave him a
Command in his Army, that ſo he might <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>Plunder</hi> from
thenceforth by <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, I ſhou'd have begun higher in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the Empire
of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> founded by <hi>Ninus,</hi> in the Blood and
Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Ruine and Deſtruction of all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and increas'd after
the ſame Methods by his Wife <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who begging of her Husband,
that ſhe might reign for Five Days, and he granting her Requeſt, ſhe put
on the Royal Ornaments, and ſitting on the Throne of uncontroulable
Majeſty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Guards to degrade and kill her Husband. Which being
done, ſhe ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Empire, adding <hi>Aethiopia</hi> to her 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104896:99"/>other Dominions, carrying a War into <hi>India,</hi> and
encompaſſing <hi>Babylon</hi> with a Magnificent Wall; at laſt was kill'd
by her Son <hi>Ninyas.</hi> Thus was the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy
eſtabliſhed in Regicides, Maſſacres, and Carnage. And by the ſame
Methods 'twas tranſlated by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bactus</hi> to the <hi>Medes.</hi> He
having caus'd <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi> the laſt, and moſt effeminate of all
the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings, to die in the midſt of his Concubines. Thus
was Treachery and Murder handed down with the Sovereign Power; till at length
<hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd them to his Country. Whoſe
Son <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> rais'd the <hi>Second <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Monarchy, on
the additional Ruines of many other Kingdoms, cementing it with the Blood of
his Brother and his Son. Yet, after all, it was tranſlated to the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> not without an equal
Guilt of Parricide, and other Exorbitant Vices. From whom at laſt it devolv'd
to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What need I mention the ſcandalous Birth of <hi>Romulus</hi>
and <hi>Remus,</hi> the Twin-Sons of an Inceſtuous <hi>Veſtal?</hi> Or,
their debauch'd Education under a <hi>common Proſtitute,</hi> fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
veil'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians, under the Title of a <hi>Wolf,</hi>
to render the Origin of their Empire Miraculous? Why ſhou'd I recount the
Horrid Fratricide committed by <hi>Romulus</hi> on <hi>Remus</hi> his Brother;
or the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Rape of <hi>Sabine</hi> Wives, Virgins, and Widows? It will
ſeem invidious, to call to Mind the deteſtable Murder of <hi>Titus
Tacius,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:104896:99"/>the Good old Captain of the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
with many other Barbarous Maſſacres. Yet theſe enormous Crimes were the
Foundations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur and Nobility, ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
afterwards to the whole Earth. And the Superſtructure was anſwerable,
through all the various Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government, even to the
Reign of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> under whom <hi>Rome</hi> gain'd the
Title of the <hi>Fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>This Emperour, though he was eſteem'd the moſt Merciful and
Juſt Prince on Earth, yet he eſtabliſh'd his Throne in the Blood of his
Kindred, ſacrificing the Children of his Uncle to the ends of State: And that
he might not deviate from the Royal Ingratitude of other Princes, he
barbarouſly extinguiſh'd the Off-ſpring of his Fathers Brother, who had
adopted him to the Inheritance of the Imperial Dignity. Scorning by an unkingly
Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſpare the glorious Names of <hi>Antony</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to whom he was ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and who had inveſted
him with the Power of being ſo inhumane.</p>
               <p>I will not make thee ſick, by rehearſing the abominable
Lives and wicked Actions of the <hi>Nero's, Domitian's, Caligula's,
He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabulus's, Galienus</hi>'s, and the reſt of thoſe Royal Monſters.
Hiſtory it ſelf bluſhes to recite ſuch Prodigies of Impiety, and their
very Names are odious to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104896:100"/>If we paſs from theſe mighty Empires
to Kingdoms of leſs Note, we ſhall ſtill trace the Foot-ſteps of the
ſame Vices. Both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Records are full of theſe Tragedies.
The Original Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> took its Riſe from the Parricide
of <hi>Dardanus;</hi> and the Female Empire of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> began in
the barbarous Maſſacre of their Husbands. All Ages and Nations afford us
Examples of this Nature; and the higheſt Honours, Dignities and Commands were
ever acquir'd and maintain'd by the Higheſt Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Honeſt <hi>Nathan,</hi> let thou and I never envy
the Nobles and Grandees of the Earth; but contented in our Humble Poſts,

<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> at
<hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is no Doubt, but when thou waſt in the <hi>Indies</hi>
the Names of <hi>Sultan Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Suja, Aurengzebe,</hi> and <hi>Morad Batche</hi>
were not leſs known to thee, than that of their Father <hi>Cha Iehan,</hi>
the <hi>Grand Mogul.</hi> Thy Buſineſs as well as Curioſity call'd thee
often to the Court, where thou haſt heard the Characters of theſe young
Princes, whoſe early Years furniſh'd the World with Matter of Noiſe, and
great Expectations, and gave the old Monarch that begat 'em, Trouble and Care
enough to keep 'em in Order, and prevent their Machinations againſt one
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as againſt himſelf. For, in thoſe Days he ſaw his
Family divided into Factions, and a Royal Envy mix'd with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, whetting
Brothers and Siſters againſt each other, who by Nature were made for the
Offices of Reciprocal Love.</p>
               <p>Surely, 'tis but a glorious Infelicity for Children to be thus
born Candidates of a Crown, when each is oblig'd by a Principle of
Self-Preſervation, to purſue his Claim, in a Method wholly repugnant to
Humanity, and the Affection that is due to thoſe of the<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104896:105"/>ſame Blood: When ſhaking off all Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
Compaſſion, the Sons of one Mother muſt ſheath their Swords in each
others Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, to prevent their own Eſtate, and raviſh a Crown by Force,
to ſave their Lives.</p>
               <p>Yet this is the Misfortune of all the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi>
Courts, that they cannot ſee a Prince aſcend the Throne, without the
Slaughter of his Brethren, and all that can be ſuſpected to pretend, or
ſtand in Competition with him for the Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>However, it muſt be confeſs'd that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Policy in this Point is far more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than that of the <hi>Ottomans</hi>
or <hi>Perſians.</hi> Who either immediately after their Poſſeſſion
of the Throne, murder in cold Blood all the reſt of their <hi>Lineage;</hi>
or at leaſt impriſon them in ſome dark Dungeon during their Lives, and
not ſeldom put out their Eyes. And this is owing to the Diſadvantage the
unhappy Children of our Monarchs lie under, in that from their Infancy they are
confin'd to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and educated under the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage of
<hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> even during the whole life of their
Father; ſo that he who is advanc'd to the Throne, has all the reſt in his
Cuſtody the firſt Hour of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Whereas, in <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> the Princes of the Blood, are
committed to able and learned Tutors, and as they grow in Years, encreaſing
alſo in Knowledge, Wiſdom and Courage, they are diſpos'd of, every one
ſuitable to his Capacity. Some being made Miniſters of 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104896:105"/>State, others Generals of Armies, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of
Provinces: Whereby each is put in a Condition to make Parties for himſelf,
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Grandees, and thoſe of Inferiour Degree, and to fortify his
Intereſt in Court and City, Country and Camp. Thus an open Field is left for
all to try their Wit and Courage in, for the Sake of Inheritance; and 'tis more
equal to let them Nobly Skirmiſh for a Crown, and make a Warlike Lottery for
Life or Death, then ſet up one with the Advantage and Character of a Butcher,
and turn the <hi>Seraill'</hi> to a <hi>Shambles,</hi> always polluted with
<hi>Royal, Innocent Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But every State purſues its own <hi>Maxims;</hi> and there are
not wanting <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> who juſtify this Inhumane
Conduct of our <hi>Sultans,</hi> as the only means to prevent Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Diſtractions and Civil Wars: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen, where there are many
Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Imperial Dignity. As it lately fell out in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not acquaint thee with what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dignities and
Commands, the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> inveſted his Four Sons. Thou could'ſt
ſufficiently inform thy ſelf of theſe Things when thou waſt at
<hi>Dehli,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> Neither need I ſay
any Thing of <hi>Rauchenara Begum,</hi> or her Siſter <hi>Saheb,</hi> the Two
Daughters of <hi>Cha Iehan.</hi> Thou that haſt been there in Perſon,
know'ſt more of theſe Things, than I who am oblig'd to the Merchants and
Travellers for all my Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:104896:106"/>But I can certify thee of ſomething,
which has been tranſacted there ſince thy Return to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Fame whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not yet arriv'd to the
<hi>Imperial</hi> City.</p>
               <p>Know then, that in the Year 1655, a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour being ſpread
abroad through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>India,</hi> that <hi>Cha Iehan</hi> was
dead; each of his Four Sons, began to lay about him for the Crown. They did all
that is uſual in ſuch Caſes for Ambitious Perſons to do, by courting
the <hi>Omrahs</hi> and <hi>Rajas</hi> with large Preſents and larger
Promiſes, by oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Souldiery</hi> with immenſe Largeſſes;
in a Word, by rouzing up the Friendſhip and Integrity of their
<hi>Adherents,</hi> and by winning over <hi>Strangers</hi> to their different
<hi>Parties,</hi> with whatſoever elſe was thought neceſſary to carry
on a proſperous War againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the Innate Deſire of
Reigning, had equally poſſeſs'd them all. But <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> which
appoints and conſummates Humane <hi>Events,</hi> had reſerv'd the Crown for
<hi>Aureng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebe,</hi> who ſurpaſs'd all the reſt in Policy and
Diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>With profound Craft this Prince over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd his younger
Brother, <hi>Morad-Batche,</hi> and put him in Chains, in the midſt of
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad</hi>'s own Army; pacifying the <hi>Officers</hi> with Bribes, and
the <hi>Common Souldiers</hi> with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Pay, whilſt he ſent
their <hi>General</hi> away Priſoner to one of his ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Caſtles.
This was the Firſt conſiderable Stroke he gave toward the gaining a Crown. 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104896:106"/>For, now he was not only rid of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, and the
moſt dangerous of all the reſt, but alſo became Maſter of his Army and
all his Treaſure, which being joined to his own, put him in a Condition, to
purſue his good Fortune with Succeſs. Yet the War laſted almoſt Six
Years, his Brother <hi>Sultan Sujah</hi> keeping him in Play on the Side of
<hi>Bengale,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Dara</hi> near the Capital Cities
<hi>Agra,</hi> and <hi>Dehli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at laſt they were both forc'd to yield to the Fortune of
<hi>Aurengzebe.</hi> In fine, he was eſtabliſh'd and now ſits on the
Throne of his Fathers, whilſt they fell Sacrifices to the Jealouſy and
Revenge of their Victorious Brother, being, as I'm inform'd taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and afterwards poyſon'd or hurry'd out of the World ſome other Way.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſes away Humane Glory, like a Cloud driven before
the Wind; or like the Smoak of a Fire, which looks bright and gay for a while,
crackles and gives Heat to all that are near it, but is either ſuddenly
quench'd with Water, or evaporates into Air, and is no more remember'd. Dear
<hi>Peſtheli,</hi> conſider that this Earth is not our Native Country: we

               <p>HEre is great Rejoycing for the Converſion of a certain

and driven 'em into their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with great Loſs on their Side, and
Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph on his. Others laugh at this as only a Court-Romance, who ſtrive to
prepoſſeſs the Nation with proſperous Stories of the King's Arms, both
by Sea and Land. Whilſt a Third Sort affirm, That thoſe Diſpatches come

               <p>THE News which thy Letter imparts, wou'd affect me with
Incredible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, were ſuch a Thing poſſible to come to paſs. It is
a long Time ſince I have been weary of dwelling in <hi>Paris,</hi> and of
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing only with <hi>Infidels.</hi> There is a perfect Antipathy between
their Humour and mine. And 'tis no ſmall Violence a Man does to his Nature in

migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily againſt the Grain. But I have thought nothing too much to do or
ſuffer, for our <hi>Great Maſter</hi>'s Intereſt. And I'm ſtill of the

Therefore 'twoud be a vaſt Comfort to be recall'd from this diſagreeable

ſerve <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with more Eaſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I have met with nothing but Perſecutions and
Reproaches from ſome at the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ever ſince I came to this

came out of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> and are but of Yeſterday, in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
with the <hi>Aboriginal</hi> People, whoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies and
Poſſeſſion of that <hi>Country,</hi> ſtretch beyond all the
<hi>Records</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> beſide.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince I read the <hi>Journal</hi> of thy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> I was inflam'd with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Deſire to ſee that Renowned
<hi>Nation</hi> to converſe with the <hi>Bramins,</hi> and pry into the
Myſteries of their Unknown Wiſdom,<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104896:110"/>which occaſions
ſo much Diſcourſe in the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not what ails me, but I promiſe my ſelf more
Satisfaction from their <hi>Books,</hi> were I capable of underſtanding the
<hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> in which they are writ, or from the Lips of thoſe
<hi>Prieſts</hi> who have 'em in their Cuſtody; than from all the
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Sages</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> I fancy I ſhou'd
find ſomething prodigiouſly ſtrange and amazing in their
<hi>Hiſtory,</hi> yet ſquaring with Human Reaſon, and Probability of
Truth. I ſhou'd meet with Arguments which I cannot yet ſtart, to prove the
<hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> Arguments clear and demonſtrative:
ſuch as wou'd eſtabliſh this <hi>Doctrin,</hi> againſt all Objections
that have or can be made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Idea</hi> which I already entertain of ſo
unmeaſurable a Duration, is only founded on my own Natural Thoughts, and
ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Concurrent Opinion of ſeveral Ancient
<hi>Philoſophers.</hi> But I ſhou'd hope to ſee it diſcover'd by
theſe <hi>Indian Records,</hi> to be a Truth as bright as the Sun, and fixed
as the Center of the Earth.</p>
               <p>There is another Thing, for which I migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily admire the
<hi>Indians;</hi> and wherein I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to imitate them to the utmoſt of
my Power: That is, the Juſtice and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs they ſhew towards the
Beaſts. 'Tis a Thing which needs a conſiderable Expiation, if by chance
they kill any living Creature.<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104896:111"/>But, if they do it
wilfully, out of Cruel Wantonneſs or Malice, and not in their own Defence;
'tis puniſh'd with Death, no leſs than if they had murder'd a Man. No care
of Health, or Fear of Diſſolution by Sickneſs, can tempt one of the
<hi>Brachman Race,</hi> to taſte a Bit of Fleſh: Much leſs cou'd they be
induc'd by the meer pleaſure of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, to commit that which they
eſteem ſo enormous a Sin, and the very Fountain of all other Vices. They
count it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Injuſtice that can be, to ſuſtain their own
Lives, by the Death of any of their Fellow-Animals; and they eſteem it a
Puſillanimity unbecoming a Man, when he dares not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Life on the
Fruits of the Earth, and the Milk of Cattel, which he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in Innocence,
and Nature affords him more than enough, of all Sorts of lawful
Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Religious</hi> Abſtinence, is the Mother of Heroick
Vertues; and thoſe who practice it inviolably, are always in a State to
contemn the World, Death, and all Momentary Things. Hence it is, that the
<hi>Indians</hi> go to the <hi>Inviſible World</hi> as cheerfully, as they
wou'd take a Journey to <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Perſia. Turky,</hi> or any
other Part of the Earth. For they eſteem <hi>Death</hi> no other than a
ſetting out, or Voyage of the <hi>Soul</hi> to a more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Religion.</p>
               <p>But, I need not inſiſt ſo much on theſe Things to thee,
who haſt been among them,<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104896:111"/>and art familiarly acquainted
with their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and inclination. I ſlide into this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
inſenſibly, by the Pleaſure I take in thinking of theſe People and
their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vertues, as a Man falls in Love with a Beautiful Woman, by
attentively gazing on her, and many Times forgets himſelf, and the
Buſineſs he was about, commits Errors and Indecencies, and through the
Confuſion of his Spirits, is quite loſt, like one in a Wood.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to my Purpoſe; a Journey to the
<hi>Indies</hi> would be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me on ſeveral other Accounts.
The very <hi>Stars</hi> of my Nativity inclin'd me to travel, and from my
Cradle in my Father's Houſe, I was transported to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
many Hundreds of Leagues from the Place of my Birth. Thou know'ſt, what a
Romer I've been ſince that Time: And I can aſſure thee, I retain the
ſame Diſpoſition ſtill. But, there's no <hi>Country</hi> under the
<hi>Moon</hi> which I wiſh to ſee with greater Earneſtneſs, than
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan;</hi> the very Name whereof ſounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſweet as
that of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Doubtleſs 'tis the <hi>Eden</hi> of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> in many Reſpects. And the Inhabitants believe there was no
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the <hi>Original Parents</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> to dwell in,
ranking the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> on that Subject in the
Number of Celebrated <hi>Fables.</hi> I approve not this Cenſure of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> yet I tell thee as a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> I dare ſay,
the <hi>Myſterious Writings</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:104896:112"/>are
quite miſunderſtood by the greateſt Part of Mankind. Neither can any Two
of his <hi>Interpreters,</hi> agree exactly which was the Particular Situation
of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Some plant that <hi>Garden</hi> in
<hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> others in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi> and a third Sort
affirm, twas in <hi>Egypt:</hi> This Man will have it in <hi>Aſia,</hi> That
in <hi>Africk.</hi> They are divided in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And I might as well
ſay, 'twas under the <hi>Red Sea</hi> between them both; and bring as many
<hi>Cabbaliſtick</hi> Proofs to defend it. But, it ſignifies nothing to us,
let it be where 'twill. Every Place is a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which a Man
phanſies to be ſo; and Nothing can beat me off from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit I have of
the <hi>Indies</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, I ſhou'd take a vaſt Delight in my Journey
thither; whether I went by the Way of the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and ſo through
the Ancient <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Colchis, Georgia</hi> and <hi>Cathay,</hi>
coaſting along the Foot of Mount <hi>Taurus:</hi> Or, by the more Common
Road, through <hi>Syria, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> Either way wou'd
afford Matter of Thought to a Contemplative Man, whilſt in ſome Places he
beholds the Ruines of Famous Cities, and his Eye revels on the Spoils of Time,
of Fire, of War, or of Earthquakes. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he beholds whole
<hi>Provinces</hi> laid Waſte, and diſpeopl'd; only meeting here and there
a few Cots, Herds, or Tents of <hi>Arabs, Tartars</hi> or
<hi>Circaſſian</hi> Herdſmen; who ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle up and down the pleaſant
Fields of<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104896:112"/>
                  <hi>Aſia,</hi> to pick and chuſe convenient
Paſtures for their Cattle.</p>
               <p>How pleaſant would it be to travel thro' my own
<hi>Country,</hi> and behold the Tents of the <hi>Sons</hi> of
<hi>Iſmael,</hi> ſpread o'er the Plains of the Vaſt and Horrible
<hi>Deſart?</hi> To meet with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirs</hi> and <hi>Sheghs</hi> of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> with their Flocks and Herds, Summering it up and down, and
Frolicking from Mountain to Valley at their Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>From this to paſs to another Variety in <hi>Perſia,</hi>
would be equally diverting. What kind of Thoughts ſhould I have whilſt on
my Bed, within the Walls of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> the <hi>Stage</hi> of ſo many
Great and Renown'd Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mention'd in <hi>Ancient Hiſtory!</hi> I
ſhould call to Mind <hi>Semiramis,</hi> the Foundreſs of that Noble City,
and all her <hi>Wars</hi> with the <hi>Indians</hi> and other <hi>Nations</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> I ſhould reflect on her Policy, and the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Son <hi>Ninyas.</hi> I ſhould conſider the various Tranſlations of
the <hi>Eaſtern Empire;</hi> the Alternate Fate of the <hi>Medes,
Aſſyrians, Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> And from thence I
ſhould Naturally fall upon the <hi>Conqueſts</hi> of <hi>Alexander the
Great;</hi> the <hi>Riſe</hi> of the <hi>Macedonian Empire,</hi> the Death of
that Mighty <hi>Hero</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Cantonizing the
<hi>Empire</hi> among his Chief Officers. Such <hi>Memoirs</hi> as theſe,
would waken my Thoughts of the Vanity of all Human Affairs, as it does at this
time: And particularly I reflect on my Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104896:113"/>in ſetting
my Heart ſo much on Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to a Country, which I am never like to
ſee.</p>
               <p>For, alas, my Dear Brother, I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure at this
Age, the Hardſhips of ſo long a Journey, as I could in my Youth. Much
Sickneſs has impair'd the Strength of my Conſtitution. I am grown as tender
as an Infant. The leaſt Puff of Wind is ready to blow out the Flame of Life.
And whereas formerly, neither Heat nor Cold, Hunger or Thirſt, Labour or
Watching could hurt me; now my Health receives Damage from every one of
theſe. I could not poſſibly out-live the Fatigue and Pain of travelling
Two or Three Days together without a Drop of Water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my panting
Soul. An Habitual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has made me the Thirſtieſt Man in the World. Then
I am not able to bear the ſcorching Heats of the Sun, to which a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
in thoſe Parts is Neceſſarily expos'd. I ſhould daily diſſolve like
Wax, or rather exhale in Smoke, in the midſt of ſo many Fervors. In a Word,
my Body is ſo Infirm, that I am very ſure to die, before I can get Half Way
to <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> let me take the neareſt Road I can.</p>
               <p>Yet if the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port</hi> ſhall
think fit to ſend me, I am reſign'd. For, I take no farther Care of my
Life, than as I may be ſerviceable to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104896:113"/>I intend to write to our Illuſtrious
Friend about it. In the mean time, do thou for me, what the Prudence of Man,

               <p>Neither the Gift, nor he that offers it, is worthy of Eſteem.
But, thou haſt Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion enough to look on Both with the Eye of a

               <p>I can never forget the former Diſcoveries of thy Friendſhip
to my Brother <hi>Peſteli</hi> and me; and in General, to all thoſe of our
Houſe: Which ſtill encourages me to expect greater Kindneſſes; nay, in
a manner, aſſures me of them: becauſe, I know the Nature of true
Generoſity is ſuch, that where it once begins to faſten on an Object, it
never ceaſes to communicate its Favours, till Damn'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104896:117"/>gives a Check to the Current. And may he be Damn'd that
then has the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ask for any more.</p>
               <p>But Praiſe be to <hi>God,</hi> my Caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; I am
not in the Number of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and Treacherous: And therefore, with
Boldneſs I preſume once more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Duſt of thy Feet,
illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> begging thy Patronage and Shelter from the
Perſecution of my Enemies; whoſe whole Endeavour is to ruine me.</p>
               <p>Thou know'ſt I came to <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1637. of the
<hi>Chriſtians Hegira.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> had then reviſited the
<hi>Sign</hi> he was in at my <hi>Nativity,</hi> juſt the Eight and Twentieth
Time. I was a mere Youngſter in the <hi>World.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my
<hi>Superiours</hi> thought me fit for this <hi>Employment.</hi> How I have
acquitted my ſelf in it ever ſince, I leave to themſelves to judge: Yet,
for Faſhion's Sake, they will be always a finding Faults. One Sycophant or
other is perpetually Railing againſt me, when they find any of the
<hi>Vizirs</hi> and other <hi>Grandees</hi> in a Humour to hearken to them. I
Fancy 'tis for Want of Diſcourſe. When they have nothing elſe to talk of,
then they fall a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of poor <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who undergoes more
Fatigues than a Hundred Thouſand ſuch 
<note n="*" place="margin">This Word <hi>Thlguch</hi> was left ſo

                  <hi>Thlguch,</hi> as they. I can't imagine, what they aim at;
unleſs it be, that they wou'd have me turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my ſelf into ſome <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:104896:118"/>Suffer me, my Noble Friend, to tell thee,
that a Man cannot want for Temptations to ſuch a Change of his
<hi>Faith,</hi> without being confin'd to a <hi>Recluſe</hi> Life. He may be
a <hi>Friar</hi> or a <hi>Libertine,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> or a
<hi>Layman,</hi> A <hi>Zealot</hi> or an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> a <hi>Chimney
Sweeper</hi> or an <hi>Abbot,</hi> which he pleaſes, according as he is
qualify'd. And I can aſſure thee, he that wou'd be a good Man, which is
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the Reſt, has incentives enough among the <hi>Profeſſors</hi>
of the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Worſhip, though the greateſt Part are wicked.</p>
               <p>As for me, I never thought that <hi>True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
conſiſted in Empty Names and Titles, in Forms and Ceremonies, in Parties
and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or in any Thing but in a Life conform to Reaſon, and to the
Will of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They take me here at <hi>Paris</hi> for a <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
Rambler,</hi> that has read ſomething more than the <hi>Pariſh-Clerks.</hi>
And becauſe they know, I underſtand <hi>Greek, Sclavonian,</hi> and Two or
Three <hi>Languages</hi> more, they wou'd fain make me a <hi>Prieſt, Doctor,
Orator,</hi> or any Thing that I wou'd accept of, to ſerve an Intereſt. And
I am compell'd to uſe, either a down-right Humility, or a forc'd Pride, that
I may handſomly evade their Courtſhip: convincing 'em ſometimes, that I
am not fit for ſuch <hi>Dignities,</hi> at other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons telling 'em, I am
above <hi>Inferiour Orders,</hi> and that nothing leſs than an
<hi>Archbiſhops Pall,</hi> or a <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s <hi>Hat</hi> will fatisfy
my Ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:104896:118"/>Thus I really diſſemble, and jeſt my
ſelf in earneſt out of Ample Eſtates, to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> his
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> Yet am traduc'd at the
<hi>Seraglio</hi> for a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> an <hi>Infidel,</hi> and God knows
what.</p>
               <p>Here's honeſt <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> undergoes the
ſame Fate; Whilſt thoſe of his own Party, eſpecially the
<hi>Rabbi</hi>'s, proclaim him every where for a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and the
<hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi> point at him, as a <hi>Turk.</hi> Only my <hi>Landlord</hi>
where I before lodg'd, who is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt old drunken <hi>Fleming,</hi> takes
<hi>Eliachim</hi> for a <hi>Saint,</hi> and ſwears he will have him
Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd after his Death: And all this, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe
<hi>Eliachim</hi> treats him now and then with a Bottle of Wine: So partial are
all Men to their own Humours and Intereſts. But the Truth on't is,
<hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi>'s an excellent Counterfeit, and my <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord</hi> is not
the only Man who has this Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for him. He paſſes for a very
<hi>Good Catholick,</hi> and a <hi>Holy Man</hi> among a great many others. His
Looks are ſo demure, his Mien ſo compos'd, and he has ſuch Godly
Diſcourſe with him, about the <hi>Sacraments, Indulgences, Miracles</hi>
and <hi>Graces</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> when he is in Company with
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> That he wou'd deceive the <hi>Spaniſh
Inquiſition,</hi> and cheat the <hi>Devil</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Such is the Violence we are forc'd to uſe to our ſelves, who
live in theſe hazardous Stations. And yet No-body conſiders us, or regards
our Zeal for the <hi>Grand<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104896:119"/>Signior.</hi> Our Reputation,
Liberty, and Lives are precarious. We are not only in perpetual Danger of the
Revenge of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> who are our real Enemies; but alſo expos'd
to the Envy, Malice and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of thoſe who ought to be our
Friends.</p>
               <p>I have often complain'd of the malicious Calumnies thrown on me
by <hi>Icingi Cap-Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lani,</hi> and his Aſſociates: And the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> were pleas'd to receive my Apologies. But now I
ſuſpect greater Treachery. I ſent an Account to the <hi>Reis Effendi</hi>
ſome Years ago, how I was dogg'd up and down the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi>
by a Fellow whom I knew not, and what Apprehenſions that put me upon. I will
acquaint thee farther, that being afraid of an <hi>Aſſaſſine</hi> in
the Dark, I arm'd my Breaſt with a Quire of Paper, which is known to be
Dagger-Proof. I was not at all miſtaken in my Gueſs. For the laſt Night,
as I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home to my <hi>Lodging,</hi> between the Hours of Nine and
Ten; I receiv'd a Stab in my aforeſaid Breaſt-Plate, right againſt my
Heart. It was not ſo dark but I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Perſon who gave me this
Blow; and Self-Preſervation taught me immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeize on him, and
grapple as cloſe as I could, extending his Arms with mine at a good
Diſtance from our Bodies. I am but little and ſhort, yet I have a ſtrong
Spring with my Body, when I am once rouz'd, as thou wilt imagine I was now.
Beſides, I have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a certain Preſence of Mind in Time 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104896:119"/>of Danger, which fails not to prompt me with the
readieſt and moſt proper Courſe to eſcape. In a Word, I wreſted the
Ponyard out of the <hi>Ruffian</hi>'s Hand, and ſtabb'd him dead with it, not
thinking it ſafe to make a Noiſe, but chuſing rather to die if my
Strength fail'd me, than by crying out for Help, run the Riſque of worſe
Conſequences: For I had long expected ſome ſuch Attempt as this upon my
Life, from my Enemies at the <hi>Port.</hi> And concluding this Fellow to be
one em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by them for that Purpoſe, I thought it no Prudence to have him
ſeiz'd by the <hi>Watch,</hi> and puniſh'd by the <hi>Law,</hi> leſt he
ſhould in Revenge diſcover me and my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to theſe
<hi>Infidels.</hi> Therefore I play'd the <hi>Executioner</hi> my ſelf, and
ſent him out of Hand to another World, to prevent his tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Tales in this.
Thou wilt ſay there was no Injuſtice in this, ſince 'twas in my own
Defence, and to ſave the Honour of my <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi> As he fell, he
uttered theſe Words in a faint broken Tone, <hi>Mahmut, my Death will be
reveng'd before long, and you cannot eſcape the Trap that is laid for
you.</hi> Then he expir'd.</p>
               <p>This made me preſently conclude, that he was employ'd by
ſome-body at the <hi>Port:</hi> For, how elſe ſhould he know my True
Name? But upon Second Thoughts, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certain, but that he was ſet at
Work by my Old <hi>Sicilian Maſter,</hi> ſince he knew my Name alſo.
However, I have greater Reaſon to ſuſpect the Former; becauſe, it is 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104896:120"/>not probable, that the <hi>Infidel</hi> would take ſo
Chargeable and Troubleſome a Method to Murder me. Neither had he Provocation
enough. Beſides, for ought I know, he may be dead. <hi>God</hi> only is
acquainted with the Truth. However, to prevent future Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of this
Nature, and a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniencies, I have remov'd my ſelf to a
New <hi>Lodging,</hi> in the moſt obſcure Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the City, and very
remote from the Place where I liv'd before, being reſolv'd alſo not to
frequent the <hi>Court,</hi> nor any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places as I have done formerly,
but to take other Meaſures for Intelligence.</p>
               <p>What I deſire of thee is, to repreſent my Caſe favourably
to the <hi>Divan,</hi> That they may approve of my Conduct. Do alſo whatever
elſe thou judgeſt the Part of a Country-man and a Friend.</p>
               <p>As for the Event, I patiently wait the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of
Deſtiny. For 'tis in vain to be too Sollicitous.</p>
               <p>Adieu, High-born <hi>Kerker,</hi> and forget not <hi>Mahmut</hi>
in his Diſtreſs. For, that is the Time, wherein true Friendſhip is
tried.</p>

               <p>BE not diſhearten'd at the Troubles which thou encountereſt
in this World of Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. But, remember the <hi>Adage</hi> of thy
<hi>Rabbi's, That EVIL which is Old as Night, is yet the Off-ſpring of every
Morning.</hi> The Ages are meaſur'd exactly, and our Hours are cheker'd with
Equal Mixtures of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Misfortune. We are not born to our own
Deſires. And as not a Man of us can remember how he was form'd in the Womb,
ſo have we no Reaſon to repine at what happens to us ſince we came out of
it. Whatever Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs took Care of us then, and
afterwards inſpir'd our Mothers and Nurſes with Tenderneſs, and a
Thouſand Degrees of Patience beyond what is Recorded of <hi>Job,</hi> the
ſame will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us to Eternity.</p>
               <p>The Deſire of Knowledge kill'd <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſame

or Birds in a Net, to find a Way out: Whilſt we do but entangle our ſelves 
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104896:121"/>the faſter, render our Reſtraint more uneaſy, and
delay the Poſſibility of our Releaſe. Whereas Patience would ſoon ſet
us free, and rank us among the <hi>Immortals.</hi> One thinks to eſcape by
high-drinking; another by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Love or Glory; and a Third conceits, he
ſhall by his Gold, be able to bribe the <hi>Watch,</hi> who Guard the laſt
<hi>Paſſes</hi> of this <hi>Life,</hi> and perſwade 'em to let him
Scamper ſafe to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Alas! Alas! All this is but the
Sophiſtry of our Paſſions. 'Tis in vain to think of haſt'ning or
retarding our Fate. Our Time is ſet, though we know not the Period.
Reſignation is our beſt Leſſon, and Prudence the next.</p>
               <p>Perhaps thou wilt call this a <hi>Sermon,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a

That is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it pleaſes thee or not, regard it not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it
agrees with Reaſon. I would fain ask of the Man who expects to have his
<hi>Will</hi> accompliſh'd in this <hi>Life,</hi> whether he can prevail upon
the <hi>Sun</hi> to riſe any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within the <hi>Artick Circle,</hi> or

               </p>
               <p>Be not troubled therefore at any Thing; but remember that thou

thee, which is not for the Good of the <hi>Whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I have ſaid is, to arm thee againſt all the
Contingencies which may aſſault thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104896:121"/>ruſhing upon thee on a ſudden from behind the Veil, which covers

               <p>I my ſelf have lately experienc'd, that it is good to be thus

               <p>I Cannot eaſily divine the Reaſons why I am ſo much
neglected by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port.</hi> Above Four Years
have paſs'd away, wherein many Notable Events have happened; yet no-body
thought it worth his Labour to inform <hi>Mahmut</hi> of any Thing. So that all
the Notices I could gain of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Tranſactions, are owing either to the
Publick News of <hi>Europe,</hi> or at beſt to ſome particular Letters of
Merchants reſiding in this City, with whom I conſerve an Intimacy, for the
ſake of Intelligence, and for other Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſhould have been in Ignorance to this Day, what
Iſſue the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi>'s Rebellion had, were it
not for an Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Interview I lately had of ſome <hi>French</hi>
Travellers, who came from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Theſe inform'd me of the
ſudden Fate of that <hi>Baſſa,</hi> when he was at the Height of all his
Grandeur, within a few Days March of the <hi>Imperial</hi> City, at the Head of
a Potent Army, and juſt upon the Point of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with the <hi>Grand
Signior.</hi> They much extol his Bravery and Reſolution: For the
<hi>French</hi> are Naturally Lovers of ſuch as dare boldly oppoſe their
Sovereign. They<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104896:124"/>equally condemn the ſly
Perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Mortaza Baſſa,</hi> to whoſe ſafe Conduct the
Generous <hi>Rebel</hi> truſted his Life, and by that Eaſineſs loſt it.
Yet they applaud <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>'s Loyalty, Courage and Wiſdom, with the
Eminent Services he afterwards did the <hi>Empire,</hi> in leading the Army
againſt <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> which at
length lifted him to the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Things had been hid from me, were not the
<hi>Nazarenes</hi> my Intelligencers. Nor ſhould I have known how the
Rebellion was carried on after his Death by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Nephew, by the Son
of <hi>Cheuſaien Baſſa,</hi> by a <hi>Bey</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
other Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. Yet ſuch Paſſages are fit for a Man in my Poſt to
be acquainted with, that he may have a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of his
<hi>Maſter</hi>'s Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſo apply himſelf more
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>It had not been amiſs, if I had receiv'd timely Intelligence
of the Death of Prince <hi>Ragotski,</hi> in Regard there was always a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Correſpondence between him and this <hi>Court.</hi> Which ceaſing by his
Death, it had been worth my Pains to obſerve, whether it would be continued
by his <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> or what other Meaſures they would take.</p>
               <p>'Tis true I was acquainted with this, but not by the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port.</hi> I heard alſo of all the following
Commotions in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> occaſion'd by the different Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Michael Apafi</hi> and <hi>Kemini Janos,</hi> the Two Rival Princes. I
was not ſorry for<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104896:124"/>this News, knowing that the
Diviſions of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> ſtrengthen the Unity and Force of the
<hi>Muſſulman Empire.</hi> I was likewiſe inform'd of the Fate of
<hi>Mortaza, Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who fell a Victim to the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Jealouſy; with many other Paſſages. But neither
from the <hi>Port,</hi> nor from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hands could I learn the leaſt
Intelligence of the <hi>Venetian</hi> War, and what Progreſs our Arms have
made in <hi>Candia, Dalmatia,</hi> and the other Dominions of the
<hi>Republick.</hi> Which makes me conclude, that either the <hi>Grand
Signor</hi>'s Reſidence at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> abated his Inclinations to
Martial Affairs, which is alſo the Common Opinion of the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> here in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> or, that the War in
<hi>Hungary</hi> for a while ſuperſeded all other Deſigns.</p>
               <p>However it be, 'tis certain the Succeſſes of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms in taking <hi>Newhauſel, Leventz, Novigrod,</hi> and
other Places of Strength, with the terrible Incurſions of the
<hi>Tartars</hi> through <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> put the whole
<hi>German Empire</hi> into a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. <hi>Embaſſadors</hi>
are ſent from the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> to all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Princes, imploring their Aſſiſtance in this General Danger of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is one arriv'd at this <hi>Court,</hi> whom they call Count
<hi>Strozzi,</hi> a Perſon of good Addreſs, and Maſter of much Eloquence.
He has prevail'd on the <hi>French</hi> King to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at his own Charges
Six Thouſand Horſe and Foot, to ſerve againſt the Victorious
<hi>Oſmans.</hi> A great many Perſons of <hi>Quality,</hi> 
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:104896:125"/>have liſted themſelves as Voluntiers; and the meaner
Sort talk of nothing but marching to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and driving the
<hi>Turks</hi> back to <hi>Scythia,</hi> from whence they firſt came.</p>
               <p>Courteous <hi>Baſſa,</hi> thou wilt laugh at the Vanity of
theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> who conſider not that by the <hi>Grace</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of his <hi>Prophet,</hi> our
<hi>Emperour</hi> is the King of all the Kings on the Earth, the Mightieſt of
the Mighty ones; the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of Honour, Power, and Unparallell'd
Majeſty; Brother and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the Sun, Moon and Stars; a Prince of a
Myſterious and Sublime Lineage, in whom are center'd all Glory and
Excellency; the Shadow of <hi>God</hi> on Earth!</p>
               <p>The Breath of Fame goes before the Van-Couriers of his Armies,
purifying all Places, and filling them with Veneration and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. The Duſt
that is rais'd by his Heroick Cavalry, paſſing through the Air, cauſes
Trembling and Aſtoniſhment in the Hearts of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The
<hi>Infidels</hi> fall before the Fatal Cymetars of <hi>True
Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of

<hi>Aſtracan.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have often wonder'd, why among the Reſt of the Nations in
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> thou would'ſt not beſtow the leaſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
Viſit on <hi>Spain!</hi> But upon more mature Conſideration, I find thou
art a Man of Judgment in Travelling. That Country lies under a very ill
Character, for the Penury of all Things neceſſary to ſuſtain the Lives
of the Natives; and by Conſequence, 'tis not to be thought, they can ſpare
much for Strangers. A very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable Region, abounding in Beggars,
Thieves and Drones: Full of Wine and Gold, yet barren of Corn, and Rich
People.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt not think this a Paradox, when thou ſhalt
conſider, That the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> have all their Corn from <hi>France,
Germany,</hi> or <hi>Sicily:</hi> And that for this and other Reaſons,
<hi>Spain</hi> is but like a Sieve through which the Immenſe Treaſures of
<hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> are drain'd into other Countries.</p>
               <p>You may Travel ſome Days together in <hi>Spain,</hi> without
ſeeing any Thing ſave the<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104896:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>dry Face of a
Deſart. And if you chance to meet with a Houſe, wherein you may ſhelter
your ſelf, and your Horſe, expect no better than a
<hi>Ramezan</hi>-Entertainment. For you muſt faſt all Day, and think your
ſelf much reſpected, if you can get a few Onions, or other Roots and Herbs,
with a Morſel of Bread and Fleſh at Night. to keep you from being
ſenſible, That you are actually ſtarving.</p>
               <p>Then the Inhabitants are the Proudeſt People on Earth. You
ſhall meet with none but Kings, Princes, Viceroys, or at leaſt Men that
conceit themſelves ſuch. They are alſo Mercileſs in their Revenge;
Cruel, Obdurate, Covetous, Moroſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable. In a Word, <hi>Spain</hi>
is the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Paradiſe; the <hi>Jews</hi> Purgatory; and the
Hell of <hi>Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I therefore commend thy Fortune, or thy Prudence rather which
would not ſuffer thee to fall into the Hands of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
nor think it worth thy Pains to breath an Air infected with ſo many Vices.
Thou haſt paſs'd through many more inviting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and art at laſt

               <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort</hi> is alſo gone with a

               <p>Here is arrived a <hi>Legate</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> to

His Name is <hi>Cardinal Chiſi.</hi> He is receiv'd with unparallell'd
Magnificence, as if he were an <hi>Angel</hi> from <hi>Heaven:</hi> For the

Beſides, all the <hi>Nations</hi> which are in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the

               </p>
               <p>This young <hi>Monarch</hi> has a large <hi>Soul.</hi> The whole
World ſeems too little to ſatisfy his Ambition. He lays the Foundation of
Deſigns, greater than thoſe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi>

               <p>I muſt deſire thee to excuſe the Confuſion and want of

               <p>It is not long ago ſince I wrote to <hi>Iſouf Eb'n
Achmed,</hi> a Kinſman of mine, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant at <hi>Aſtracan;</hi> and among
other Things, I took Notice of his neglecting to ſee <hi>Spain</hi> in his
Travels; for he has been in moſt of the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> and over
all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> In that Letter I deſcrib'd
<hi>Spain</hi> in its worſt Colours, Now I will ſhew it to thee in another
Figure, without ſwerving from the Truth: For every Country has its
Perfections and Excellencies, as well as its Defects and Blemiſhes.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Spain</hi> have a barren Soil for Corn, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made
Amends for that Fault, in the Purity of the Air, and the Plenty of Fruits: The
Sands of her Rivers are the moſt perfect Gold. Her Villages, tho' few, are
greater, and more Populous than ſome Cities, witneſs <hi>Madrid.</hi> Her
Mountains are of <hi>Iron, Marble,</hi> and <hi>Jaſper.</hi> Her Vallies
underlaid with <hi>Lead, Braſs,</hi> and <hi>Silver. Spain</hi> of old was
the <hi>Tharſis</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the <hi>Ophir</hi> of the
<hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and the <hi>Peru</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thoſe Days the Inhabitants of <hi>Spain</hi> were Famous
for their Fortitude, and Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104896:129"/>Conſtancy. 'Tis
recorded, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Sagunto</hi> in the Province of
<hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> when they were beſieg'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and ſore
preſs'd by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> choſe to burn themſelves, with
their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and all their Wealth, rather than yield to their
Enemies.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Fidelity</hi> alſo was ſo remarkable, that ſome
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours had always a Guard of <hi>Spaniards</hi> near
their Perſons; as the <hi>French</hi> King, the Pope, and other Princes do
now confide in the truſty <hi>Swiſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' there remain ſtill ſome ſcatter'd Remnants of the
Ancient Vertue among them, eſpecially in <hi>Biſcay</hi> and
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> yet the greateſt Part of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. They make no Figure now in the World, but only for their Gold,
and the Vaſtneſs of their Dominions. For they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the beſt
half of <hi>America,</hi> are Lords of Two Mighty Empires, and not without
large Territories in the other <hi>Three</hi> Quarters of the World. Yet the
too great Extent of their Power has weaken'd its Vigor; the Affluence of their

<hi>Philoſophy</hi> at <hi>Fez.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY the Faith and Obedience I owe to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammed</hi> our Holy
<hi>Lawgiver;</hi> by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and all that is eſteem'd Sacred
among the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> I ſwear, thy long Silence made me conclude
my Firſt Letter was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to thee. But now I'm convinc'd to the
contrary. Thy generous Anſwer has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd my Apprehenſions, and fill'd me
with Complacency. Henceforth I ſhall reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd and confident of thy
Friendſhip, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing my ſelf vaſt Improvements from ſo learned a
Converſation, tho' only by Letters at many hundred Leagues Diſtance.</p>
               <p>As to what thou requireſt of me, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the various
Languages of <hi>Europe,</hi> I will inform thee the beſt I can, according to
the Obſervations I have made, and the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I have receiv'd from Men
of Letters, and from Books, which are the Pictures of learned Souls, Mirrors
wherein they may behold their own Perfections, whilſt they are on Earth, and
after their Departure to the <hi>Inviſibles,</hi> other Men may ſee the
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Beauties of their Mind repreſented to the Life. For <hi>Words</hi>
are the perfect <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> or at leaſt
its <hi>Mezzo-Tinto.</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:104896:131"/>They are the expreſs
Portraicture of Divine and Humane Reaſon. Thus the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> is
call'd by ſome of our Holy Doctors, <hi>The True Image of Original and
Increated Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of all the Words and Languages on Earth, thou know'ſt the
Preheminence has been for ever given to thoſe of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and
among them to the <hi>Arabian,</hi> both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its Purity, and of its
Antiquity, from whence it is Styl'd the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi> of Languages,
the <hi>Dialect</hi> of the Bleſſed above.</p>
               <p>Thou know'ſt, that for this Reaſon it is, the <hi>True
Faithful</hi> covet no <hi>Species</hi> of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ardently than to be
perfectly skill'd in ſo Divine a Speech, wherein the <hi>Volume of
Celeſtial Majeſty</hi> was penn'd in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of
<hi>God,</hi> and ſent down on Earth by the Hand of <hi>Gabriel, Prince</hi>
of the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> who fly on the Errands of the
<hi>Omnipotent.</hi> It was ſent I ſay, to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who could
neither write nor read, that the World might be convinc'd of its Divine
Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Yet the Incredulous will not believe: Tho' it is manifeſt to any
Man of Impartial Senſe, That a Perſon altogether ignorant of Letters, could
not poſſibly compoſe a Book, the moſt Elegant that ever was penn'd in
the World, and wherein not the leaſt Blemiſh or Contradiction can be found
from the <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Preface,</hi> to the <hi>laſt
Verſicle,</hi> which winds up the whole <hi>Volume.</hi> Oh! obdurate Hearts
of <hi>Infidels;</hi> Oh! wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104896:131"/>Blind, that ſhut
their Eyes againſt the Splendors of <hi>Eternal Light:</hi> Oh! reſolvedly
Deaf, that ſtop their Ears againſt the Voice of <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Prophet,</hi> neither will they liſten to the ſoft Whiſpers which are
wafted from <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> who for the Sake of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Tongues, of which they are paſſionately
enamour'd, educate their Children in a fair Way to believe all the Monſtrous
Fictions of the Ancient Poets, or at leaſt all the Lying Tales and
<hi>Legends</hi> of their own Prieſts, which are Ten Times more Fabulous than
the Former, and more Inconſiſtent with Reaſon. And this they do rather
than be at the Pains of learning <hi>Arabick,</hi> which would inſtruct them
in Truths as Clear and Serene as the <hi>Orient</hi> Sun.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay little of theſe Two ancient Languages of
<hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> in Regard they being now grown Obſolete,
and only to be learn'd in Schools, thou, no doubt, art vers'd in them <hi>ad
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguem,</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi> phraſe it.</p>
               <p>That which ſeems propereſt for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thee of, is,
That the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue appears like an old Antiquated
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thruſt out of Doors by her Four un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Daughters, <hi>Italian,
French, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Portugueze.</hi> Theſe are her Natural
Off-ſpring, begot during the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſts in the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> and degenerating after that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was in its Decline. So
that now they<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104896:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>are taken for no better than
<hi>Mongrels</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards.</hi> In <hi>Spaniſh</hi> there is a
great Mixture of <hi>Gothiſh</hi> and <hi>Moreſco</hi> Words; the
<hi>French</hi> retain many of their old <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Idioms. The
<hi>Italian</hi> is corrupted with a Hotch-poth of Words, left by the
<hi>Vandals, Huns</hi> and <hi>Longobards.</hi> Yet that Fault is recompenc'd
by Abundance of <hi>Greek</hi> Etymologies. As for the <hi>Portugueze,</hi>
'tis but a Dialect of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and lies under the ſame
Imperfections.</p>
               <p>The only pure <hi>Maternal</hi> Languages now current among the
common People in any Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> are the <hi>Teutonick,
Sclavonick,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh:</hi> The Firſt is ſpoken in
<hi>Germany</hi> to Perfection, but corruptly in <hi>Suedeland, Denmark</hi>
and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> The Second is common to the
<hi>Hungarians, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians, Poles, Raſhians,</hi> and many other Nations.
The laſt is confin'd to the <hi>Welſh,</hi> a People inhabiting a Corner of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> driven thither by the Victorious <hi>Saxons</hi> their
Conquerors, above a Thouſand Years ago. As for the Reſt, they are only
mix'd Dialects, and ſo not worth taking Notice of; except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Mountainous
Part of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Inhabitants are ſaid to ſpeak Pure
<hi>Arabick</hi> at this Day. They are ſuppos'd to be a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the
<hi>Moors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Criticks here in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> uſe to give theſe
following Rules in Reference to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. If you would addreſs to
<hi>God,</hi> ſpeak in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> becauſe of their
Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Purity, and Majeſtick Loftineſs. If to <hi>Kings,</hi> ſpeak
in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> in Regard of its<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104896:132"/>low Pronunciation
and Gravity: If to <hi>Men,</hi> uſe <hi>Italian,</hi> to <hi>Women,
French;</hi> to <hi>Dogs, Welſh:</hi> But if you would affright an
<hi>Enemy,</hi> or the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, ſpeak
<hi>High-Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They relate a Story of a <hi>German</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at the
<hi>French</hi> Court, who deliver'd his Meſſage in <hi>Teutonick;</hi>
which when a certain <hi>Grandee</hi> heard, and took Notice of its harſh and
ſtrong <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> he ſwore 'twas his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That this was the
Language wherein <hi>God</hi> curs'd <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and the
<hi>Serpent.</hi> The <hi>German</hi> turning to him, anſwer'd brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>'Tis poſſible,</hi> Monſieur, <hi>it may be ſo; but then I hope
you'll grant, that</hi> French <hi>was the Occaſion of this Curſe, when
the</hi> Devil <hi>choſe to tempt</hi> Eve <hi>in that Language for its
Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, wheedling her</hi> à la mode de Paris, <hi>to eat the
forbidden Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Renowned <hi>Muſu,</hi> do me the <hi>Honour</hi> of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Letters: Inſtruct me in Things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I'm ignorant: Make me familiar with

               <p>Tell me, thou who art Converſant in the <hi>Science</hi> of

               <p>THE <hi>French</hi> have had ſo many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Joy of
late, that it is hard to determine, which affects them moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The Satisfaction which the <hi>Pope</hi> gave this
<hi>Monarch,</hi> for the Injuries formerly done to his Embaſſador at
<hi>Rome,</hi> began the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of the <hi>French</hi> Court. I have already
ſent Intelligence of that Quarrel, and how high the Reſentments of the King
flew, on the ſame Day that he receiv'd the Firſt News of ſo Barbarous an
Affront. Now I ſhall acquaint thee, That there enſu'd a <hi>Treaty</hi>
between them at <hi>Piſa,</hi> a City of <hi>Italy</hi> in the Dukedom of
<hi>Tuſcany,</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> Troops had terrified them into a
<hi>State-Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> by the menacing Approaches they made toward the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Territories,</hi> through the <hi>Principalities</hi> of
<hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma.</hi> Theſe Two are Friends to <hi>France,</hi>
and their Intereſt makes them ſo, in Regard that Crown protects 'em from
the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who is always eſteem'd an III
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, whoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions lie next to
his. For this <hi>Roman</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104896:135"/>is very Potent and
Rich; he would in a ſhort time be <hi>Lord</hi> of all <hi>Europe</hi> in
<hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> as well as <hi>Spirituals,</hi> were he not curb'd by the
King of <hi>France</hi> and his <hi>Allies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This makes all the <hi>little Sovereigns</hi> round about
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſtand in Awe of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> who was born to command
<hi>Crowned Heads.</hi> Wonder not at the Expreſſion: For I tell thee,
ſome of the greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> are his Penſioners. This
very Quarrel with the <hi>Pope,</hi> has gain'd the <hi>French</hi> King Three
<hi>Cardinals</hi> more than were his Friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion of the <hi>Treaty</hi> was, That the
<hi>Pope</hi> ſhould ſend a Legate <hi>de Latere</hi> into <hi>France,</hi>
to pacify the King's Wrath; and that the <hi>Militia</hi> or <hi>Roman
Guards</hi> whom they call <hi>Sbirri</hi> and <hi>Corſes,</hi> ſhould be
for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aboliſh'd, and a <hi>Pyramid</hi> to be erected over againſt
their Guard-Houſe, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> declaring their Crime and Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>This put the Court of <hi>France</hi> into a very Jolly Humour.
They fell preſently to Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Revelling; and the King's next
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was the Conqueſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> To this End he ſent the Duke
of <hi>Beaufort</hi> with a Fleet of Great Ships, to clear the Seas of
<hi>African Corſairs,</hi> that ſo an Army might be ſafely tranſported
from <hi>Toulon,</hi> and landed on the oppoſite Shore. His Deſign in this
was to reduce the Inhabitants of thoſe Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Countries to the old
<hi>Idolatry</hi> of their <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,</hi> to plant there the
<hi>Nazarene Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:104896:135"/>and make himſelf the
Sole Lord and Proprietor of <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot divine what Succeſs he will have in this great
Enterprize; but it appears as if <hi>God</hi> were angry with the
<hi>Muſſulmans:</hi> Such continual Loſſes they ſuſtain by Land and
Sea.</p>
               <p>It is with no ſmall Grief I ſaw not long ago, the
<hi>French</hi> who ſerv'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> this Campagne, return to
<hi>Paris</hi> laden with the Spoils of <hi>True Believers.</hi> I cannot
behold the very Cymetars and Enſigns which theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> took
from the vanquiſh'd <hi>Oſmans,</hi> hang up in their <hi>Temples</hi> as
<hi>Trophies</hi> of their <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> without inexpreſſible
Paſſion and Regret. 'Tis ſaid here, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> has loſt
in <hi>Hungary</hi> above Thirty Thouſand Men this Campagne; whereof Ten
Thouſand were kill'd in one Battle, and a Hundred and Fifty Colours taken,
with Sixteen Cannons.</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe <hi>Giafers</hi> grate my Ears with another
<hi>Bravado,</hi> boaſting that one <hi>French</hi> Ship of War fought Seven
Hours with Three and Thirty of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Gallies, ſunk
Five, ſcatter'd the reſt, and came off with a compleat Victory.</p>
               <p>'Tis a vaſt Advantage the <hi>French</hi> have in the
Situation of their Country, in that it is waſh'd on the <hi>South</hi> by the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> by the <hi>Main Sea:</hi> So that
'tis eaſy for them to curb the greateſt Part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> on one

ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd their <hi>Original</hi> Splendor.</p>
               <p>The beſt Manuſcripts are loſt, unleſs the
<hi>Indians</hi> have preſerv'd 'em. Our Fathers grew Torpid, Stupified, and
Deſperate, under the Publick Calamities which overwhelm'd whole Cities,
Provinces, Kingdoms, and Empires: There was no Encouragement for a Scribe or a
Man of Letters, to put himſelf to a needleſs Toil in labouring to
preſerve the Records which came from Heaven: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104896:137"/>of the World Inviſible, Celeſtial, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and

<hi>Firſt and the Laſt;</hi> even of the <hi>Divinity</hi> which
comprehends all Things, and is it ſelf comprehended of none.</p>
               <p>Had they gone about ſuch a Task, they knew that ſome ill
Fate or other would ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Writings, and bury them in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Oblivion. Hence it is, that at this Day we can hardly boaſt of the
Footſteps of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Knowledge, a few Fragments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of
<hi>Primitive</hi> Learning, ſcatter'd up and down in divers
<hi>Authors,</hi> and much <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated</hi> with the vain

ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclin'd, or forc'd, to flatter the Age wherein he liv'd, and not

<hi>Philoſophy</hi> extant on this ſide the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How thoſe <hi>Brachmans</hi> only had the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to
conſerve ſo Sacred a Treaſure, can be no other way made out, than by
their own conſtant Tradition, that the Deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> never reach'd
thoſe utmoſt Borders of the Land toward the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And perhaps
the ſame Reaſon may be given for the untrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Chronologies</hi> of
the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For tho' they differ in the
Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rites of their Religion, in their Laws, Cuſtoms, and manner
of Government, yet they both agree in affirming the World<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104896:138"/>to be indeterminately Old, puting a certain Number of Millions of
Years, for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, far beyond it; which is but a modeſt Retrenchment
of their own Thoughts, as if they were unwilling, it ſhould be falſly
cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd that they aim'd at an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay, That the <hi>Firſt Matter</hi> is
<hi>Co-eternal</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> is <hi>Co-eval</hi>
with the <hi>Sun,</hi> produc'd alſo, and depending after the ſame Manner.
For as the <hi>Light</hi> diffus'd through the Air, is not properly the
<hi>Sun,</hi> but an Inſeparable Effect of it; ſo the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi>
is not <hi>God,</hi> but his Production, ever ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on him, and
never to be divided from his <hi>Eternal Eſſence.</hi> And for ought I
ſee, the moſt ſignificant Language in the World has no other way to
expreſs things of this abſtruſe Nature. They are too ſublime for humane
Thought; much more do they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the Power of Speech. All the
<hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi> on Earth are too barren of Words, and Words too defective in
Senſe, to deſcribe the Ineffable Secrets of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the various Ranks of Beings, the Infinite Diverſity of
Forms, reſulting from the <hi>Firſt Matter,</hi> they think it reaſonable
to believe, That they were ſucceſſively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in time; every one in
its Order, and according to its Perfection.</p>
               <p>I tell thee, it appears much more Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for me to believe
this, than that the <hi>Firſt Matter</hi> it ſelf was produc'd out of
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about Five or Six Thouſand Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, as the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeem to teach.<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104896:138"/>Rather than
ſtarve my Reaſon with ſo ſhort and <hi>Idea</hi> of the World's Age, I

ſuppoſe an <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Spaces</hi> and <hi>Worlds,</hi> an

               <p>I do not pretend to be ſingular, or ſet up for a

               </head>
               <p>WHat is this World, that on all ſides Invades our Senſes?
This Earth under our Feet; thoſe Clouds whirling over our Heads; theſe
Winds ſhaking the Trees; that Azure Sky, with all its glittering Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
What's all this but an Eternal Dream; a mere Shadow of <hi>God Almighty</hi>'s
Thoughts? 'Tis pleaſant living in it; 'tis alſo painful. In his Senſe
this Univerſe is perfectly good; in ours 'tis mixed with evil. He made it for
his own Diverſion, and our Scrutiny. 'Tis to us a Field of Riddles, and
Contradictions. In <hi>Summer</hi> we curſe the Heat, and in <hi>Winter</hi>
blaſpheme the Cold. Yet we bleſs both the one and the other, when we feel
'em in due Meaſure and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. One Hour, this Colour pleaſes the Eye,
another that; and perhaps in the next, 'tis diſguſted at them both. We
never find Reſt or Content in any thing. The ſofteſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick at ſome
times grates our Ears, like the croaking of Toads. The moſt agreeable
O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, are as the Smell of a Sepulchre, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and abominable. The
moſt delectable Wines and Savoury Meats, at ſuch Seaſons, are unpalatable
as the Beverage and Diet of<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104896:139"/>Hell. Neither can the more
inſinuating Charms of Women, put us in a better Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. All the whole
Syſtem of Nature join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, is not ſufficient to afford us Eaſe.
Nothing but a Ray from the Omnipotent can alleviate our Melancholy, or give us
a taſte of our ſelves. For we are the very <hi>Deity</hi> in ſcatter'd
Fragments; or we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Drops of the <hi>Divine Eſſence:
Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits</hi> of <hi>Eternity;</hi> by <hi>Fate</hi> or
<hi>Chance,</hi> fix'd in proper Vehicles of <hi>Time,</hi> and
<hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> O <hi>Santone!</hi> This whole <hi>Corporeal
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> is but a <hi>Web</hi> ſpun from the Bowels of an
<hi>Infinite God,</hi> and wrought with inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Artifice, to catch
<hi>Immaterial Forms, Idea's</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> in, which are the Genuine
Off-ſpring of the <hi>Eternal Mind.</hi> We Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Humane Race, are but
ſo many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the <hi>Divinity</hi> in Diſguiſe, trapan'd into
Bodies, by certain hidden <hi>Baits, Magnets</hi> and <hi>Charms</hi> lurking
in <hi>Embryo's,</hi> with which we have ſome Sympathy. We are all
<hi>Gods</hi> in Maſquerade. So are the Beaſts of the Field, the Birds of
the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Let us not therefore condemn the Antique Ceremonies of
<hi>Gentile</hi> Religion, which taught Men to adore the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and
<hi>Stars;</hi> the <hi>Elements</hi> and all that is within their
Circumference, eſpecially the <hi>Souls</hi> of departed <hi>Heroes,
Demi-Gods, Nymphs,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe <hi>Beings</hi> which are the
<hi>Eldeſt Progeny</hi> of <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi> For in ſo doing, they
did but build Altars to the Original<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104896:140"/>Fountain of the
Univerſe. Since <hi>God</hi> is in the Winds, in the Rain, in the Thunder,
Lightning, Hail and other <hi>Meteors;</hi> in the Heavens, and Air, Sun, Moon
and Stars; in the Fire, Earth and Water; in Plants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals; finally,
ſince he is in the Elements, and every thing compounded of them; he is not
only in them, but is theſe very Things by an <hi>Ineffable Production</hi> of

where thou and I, and every divided <hi>Atome</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall meet, be

ſtill we have the ſame, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reaſon to value our ſelves as

be <hi>Eternal,</hi> every <hi>Atome</hi> being ſo, of which we are
compounded. In the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> there's no
ſuch thing as an <hi>Origin</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:</hi> Each <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> with them, is

<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>World</hi> to another; danc'd to the meaſures of
<hi>Fate,</hi> been Parts of the Orbs above, and of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns below;
ſtray'd through the Heavens and all the Elements; taken an Univerſal
Carier, through <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Endleſs Spaces;</hi> and are now
(as fix'd as we ſeem in theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Hulks of Fleſh) in the ſame
Hurly-Burly as ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bodies which we carry about us, are not compounded of
the ſame <hi>Atomes</hi> as they were Seven Years ago. There is a perpetual
Flux and Reflux of <hi>Particles.</hi> We die as faſt as we live. Every
Moment ſubſtracts from<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104896:141"/>our Duration on Earth, as much
as it adds to it. We move, breathe, and do all things by <hi>Paradox.</hi> Our
very <hi>Eſſence</hi> is a <hi>Riddle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With an open Heart therefore, I applaud thy Religious Negligence
of Humane Affairs, in that thou art Divinely careleſs of thy ſelf, and
every thing elſe, ſave only to conſerve thy Innocence.</p>
               <p>What ſignifies it, whether we believe the <hi>Written Law</hi>
or the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> whether we are Diſciples of <hi>Moſes,

Bramin?</hi> Of what Import is it, whether we pray or not? Whether we kneel
before Images, or in a naked <hi>Moſque?</hi> 'Twill be all one in the
winding up. We are but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of Chance. As we live, ſo ſhall we
die; and <hi>God</hi> knows what will become of us afterwards; neither is it
worth our while to be ſollicitous, ſince we can be certain of nothing.
Perhaps, every <hi>Atome</hi> of which we are made, may be ſcatter'd from the
reſt; we may be tranſported Piece-meal into Ten Hundred Thouſand Millions
of Worlds; and ſeven-fold as many Years may expire, before Two the minuteſt
<hi>Particles</hi> of our Frame, meet together again. We need not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at all this; nothing can hinder us from being <hi>Immortal</hi> and
<hi>Eternal,</hi> tho' it be but in Fragments.</p>
               <p>Go on then, Sacred Vagabond, Pious Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, Holy Fugitive; go
on, to aſſert in the courſe of thy Life, this great Truth, <hi>That all
things<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104896:141"/>depend on Everlaſting Chance</hi> or
<hi>Deſtiny.</hi> Thy Actions ſhall reprove the Hypoctites of the Age, who
abound in Specious Words. And thy Divine Indifference ſhall condemn the
Helliſh Zeal of furious Bigots, who think to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> and atone
for their Sins, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Humane Blood, and maſſacring all that are
not of their Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Fate,</hi> ſhall

Moſul,</hi> or even at <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> where thou reſideſt, though
that City want many Delights, which others enjoy. However, I ſhou'd there
encounter with <hi>Tiara's</hi> and <hi>Turbants,</hi> the very Sight of which
wou'd half cure my Diſcontent. May my Portion be with <hi>Tagot,</hi> if I am
not tyr'd with ſeeing Nothing but theſe Hats, and Short-Coats, theſe
ridiculous <hi>Franks,</hi> theſe <hi>Apes</hi> without Tails. And then to
hear 'em rant againſt the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and all <hi>True
Believers;</hi> to hear 'em blaſpheme the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God,</hi>
curſe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> revile the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and all the
<hi>Mollahs,</hi> with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Impertinences, which none but ſuch
<hi>Reprobates, Giaurs,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> wou'd be guilty of; makes me
either wiſh my ſelf Deaf, or that my Tongue were at Liberty to anſwer
them. But, much rather wou'd I deſire to be in a Place, where I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
my Ears, to receive the <hi>Salem</hi> from my<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104896:143"/>Friends
that are <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and to hear the Name of <hi>God</hi> devoutly
bleſs'd on any Occaſion that awakens the Senſe to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
               <p>Oh that I were among my Countrymen, the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who
dwell in Tents, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick about from Hills to Valleys, taſting by Turns
the various Sweets of the Foreſt and the Plain! The Groves and Meadows,
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and Arable Grounds, Cities and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, all contribute to their
Delight. They want no Innocent Joy that the Earth can afford. Their Wealth
conſiſts in the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Sheep, Camels, Goats and Oxen. And for
them is all their Care, that they may not want Graſs and Water in due
Seaſon. As for themſelves, they are reſign'd to <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So are the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ſleep in Hords or Waggons;
the only <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of <hi>Aſia:</hi> Whoſe Life is a perpetual
<hi>Campagne,</hi> from the Cradle to the Grave. Their Labour and Eaſe are
derived from the ſame Fountain; exerciſing themſelves on Horſe-back at
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years old; and feeding on the Milk of Mares as ſoon as they are wean'd
from their Mother's Breaſts. Toil and Recreation with them are one and the
ſame thing, ſince they know no other Pleaſure but what conſiſts in
Riding, Fighting and Conquering; or elſe in Death, which they believe
tranſlates them to new Joys, and thoſe more poignant than they knew before.
Therefore they bravely court it at the Point of a Sword, or the 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104896:143"/>Mouth of a Cannon: Nothing being more ſcandalous or
hateful than a Coward among them.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, the very <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi>
and <hi>Taurica Cherſoneſus,</hi> with the Reſt of thoſe Horrible Fens
and Marſhes, on the <hi>North</hi> of the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> which
encompaſs the Dominions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> affects me with a
Paſſion, or rather ſuch a Medly of Paſſions, as I know not how to
name. Thoſe ample Deſarts, thoſe untrack'd Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, appear to my
Imagination, like the Limits of this old Habitable World; and the Frontiers of
ſome new, ſtrange and unknown Region; ſome <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi>
where an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Deſolation and Silence keep their Seat for ever: Where
no Voices are heard but thoſe of uncouth <hi>Satyrs, Fauns,</hi> and other
<hi>Exotick Tenants</hi> of the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> No other
Sound but the whiſtling and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Winds. No Proſpect but that of
Trees which have appear'd from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of Time, and where thoſe are
want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Eye is wearied in a long, endleſs Waſte, which nothing
ſeems to bound, but the declining Arch of diſtant Skies, or low, black,
melancholy Clouds, skirted with Miſts and Fogs, Eternal Mantles of the
<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Climes.</p>
               <p>This is the Figure of thoſe ſolitary Tracts where I wou'd
chuſe to live, rather than in a City which ſtifles me, with too much
Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every Thing, but freſh Air, and honeſt People.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Iſouf,</hi> the Contrarieties which
we find in Earthly Things, give a Guſt to each other. And, the moſt
Magnificent Palace wou'd ſeem a Priſon, were a Man always confin'd to live

Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMidſt the Variety of Obligations which I have to diſcharge,
I forget not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey thy Commands. I have already in my former
<hi>Diſpatches</hi> acquainted thee with the Characters, and ſome
Remarkable Paſſages of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. <hi>Cardinal Richlieu, Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> Now I will ſay ſomething of the Famous
<hi>Mareſchal de Turenne,</hi> whoſe Fame reaches whereſoever the
<hi>French</hi> Wars have been talk'd of for theſe Forty Years. The Name of
this great <hi>General,</hi> is <hi>Henry de la Tour d' Auvergne,</hi> Son to
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bouillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:104896:144"/>When his Father was near his Death, he
call'd for both his Sons, whereof this was the youngeſt. And among other
Exhortations, he recommended in a ſpecial Manner Three Things to their
Practice: Never to renounce or change their <hi>Religion:</hi> Never to take up
<hi>Arms</hi> againſt their <hi>Sovereign:</hi> Nor to provoke the
<hi>Firſt Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, the <hi>Mareſchal de Turenne</hi> has
hitherto kept it inviolably, but he has faulter'd in both the other; having
revolt-from his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Service during his <hi>Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and
oppos'd the Intereſt of <hi>Cardinal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini,</hi> when the
<hi>Parliament</hi> perſecuted that <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, this hinders not but that he is a Great Souldier, and
beſides he is ſince recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the <hi>King.</hi> He ſeems to be born
for <hi>Martial</hi> Affairs. And they relate of him, That when he was but Ten
Years Old, and his <hi>Governour</hi> miſſing him, had ſought up and down
every where for him, he at length found him faſt aſleep on a
<hi>Cannon,</hi> which he ſeem'd to embrace with his little Arms as far as
they wou'd reach. And when he ask'd why he choſe ſuch a <hi>Couch</hi> to
lie on, he made Anſwer, <hi>That he deſign'd to have ſlept there all
Night, to convince his Father that he was hardy enough to undergo the Fatigues
of War, though the Old Duke had often perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the
Contrary.</hi> And to ſpeak the Truth, no Man was more Careleſs of his Body
than this <hi>Prince.</hi>

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:104896:147"/>At Fourteen Years of Age he was ſent
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Holland</hi> to ſerve in the Army under the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Orange,</hi> who was his Uncle. There he apply'd himſelf to all the
Diſcipline of War, doing the Duty of a Private Soldier: Which is the common
Way that <hi>Cadets</hi> or Younger Brothers take to riſe to the moſt
Eminent <hi>Offices.</hi> He was equally forward in Labours and Perils, never
ſhunning any Fatigue or Hazard, which might bring him Glory, yet he was not
raſh, the Common Vice of Youth, but temper'd all his Actions with an
extraordinary Prudence and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Judgment, beyond what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from him at thoſe Years. Yet, on the other Side, his Counſels were not
ſlow and Flegmatick, being of a very ready Forecaſt; and he ſeldom fail'd
in his Contrivances. He was ſoon promoted to a Place of <hi>Command.</hi> And
the Exactneſs of his Conduct rais'd him a vaſt Reputation, ſo that by
Degrees he at laſt arriv'd to that Height of Power and Honour he now
poſſeſs. He appears Indefatigable in his Body, and of an Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Reſolution. He hates Flatterers, that think to gain his Friendſhip by
praiſing him. And is equally averſe from making Uſe of ſuch fawning
Inſinuations to others, though the Greateſt <hi>Princes</hi> of the
<hi>Blood,</hi> or the <hi>Firſt Miniſter</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>He has alſo a certain Stedfaſtneſe of Spirit which cannot
be warp'd by any Artificial Addreſſes, though made to his own apparent
Advantage, if they propoſe to him any<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104896:147"/>Thing that has the
leaſt Semblance of what is baſe and diſhonourable. Thus he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſent that the Honour of taking <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> ſome Years ago,
ſhould be aſcrib'd to <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> tho' that
<hi>Miniſter</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately courted him to it, offering him the Greateſt
Commands in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> if he would do him that Service; and the
<hi>Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> knew it might prove his Ruin, if he did not. Yet ſuch
was his Integrity and Love to the Truth, that by no means would he be brought
to condeſcend to this Meaneſs of Spirit: Yet, perhaps it might only proceed
from the Averſion which in thoſe Days he had for the <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
Many times it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, That a <hi>Natural</hi> Paſſion is made to
paſs for a Moral Vertue. Beſides, perhaps he was unwilling to be depriv'd
of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry due to him for that Important Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>He is a Man of few words, and ſo ſecret in all his
Counſels, that no-body knows any thing of his Deſigns, till he puts them in
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Every Man eſteems him the moſt Liberal <hi>Prince</hi> of this
Age, having no other Regard for Money, than, as it ſerves the
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his <hi>Family,</hi> and enables him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige his
Friends.</p>
               <p>In a Word, whatever Vices he may have, he is yet endu'd with
ſo many Good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Vertues, that he is belov'd by all the Nation,
and in Particular Favour with his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> who treats him not as a
<hi>Subject,</hi> but as one of his moſt intimate Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:104896:148"/>May <hi>God,</hi> who has rais'd up this
Great <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to aggrandize the <hi>French Monarchy,</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſupply the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and Expert

                  </note>THE <hi>French King</hi> has lately receiv'd a

                  </q> Thou know'ſt where the Force of the <hi>Poet</hi>'s Wit lies,
having travelled in <hi>France</hi> and learned their <hi>Language.</hi> The
<hi>King</hi> ſmil'd at the Reading of it, and ſeem'd to be pleas'd with
the Frankneſs of the <hi>Author,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He was worth a Thouſand
Flatterers.</hi> He promiſed likewiſe to give him Five Hundred
<hi>Louis's</hi> for his Wit, if he would diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104896:149"/>as alſo to pardon him on his Royal Word. But the
<hi>Satyriſt</hi> would not venture himſelf, knowing that <hi>Kings</hi>
have more ways than one to revenge themſelves of Private Perſons, their
<hi>Subjects.</hi> However, ſince the <hi>King</hi> appear'd ſo well
pleaſed with this, he was reſolv'd to give him another Touch of his Skill.
And the very next Morning in the ſame Place, the <hi>King</hi> found theſe
words: 
<q> 
                     <l>Tu ne le Sçaura pas Louis,</l>

                  </q> There have been

Some ſay one thing, and ſome another. And there are not wanting ſuch as

enough for thee to know, that theſe People are at odds now: And in Regard the
Strength of both <hi>Nations</hi> lies in their Shipping, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to cover the <hi>Northern</hi> Seas with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies: But the <hi>Iſlanders</hi>
ſtill get the beſt on't. They claim the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of thoſe
Seas, and in my Opinion they deſerve it. I ſpeak according to my
Intelligence; being aſſur'd. that no Nation ever prevail'd againſt 'em on
that Element.</p>
               <p>They have had a terrible Fight this <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> wherein
the <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt Seventeen <hi>Ships</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:104896:151"/>of
<hi>War,</hi> beſides Veſſels of ſmaller Note. The <hi>Commander</hi>
of the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> is call'd the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> a
Great General, and Brother to the <hi>Engliſh King.</hi> His Name was famous
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> during the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War.
And tho the <hi>Land</hi> afforded him no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſions of Glory, yet he
has found ſome in the <hi>Sea. Opdam,</hi> the Greateſt <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi>
that ever the <hi>Dutch</hi> could boaſt of, fell a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to his
<hi>Genius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the more Particular in this Relation, becauſe it is fit
thou ſhould'ſt know the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of all the Brave <hi>Heroes</hi>
living.</p>
               <p>Since this Fight, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> has
ſent an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh Court</hi> to mediate a
<hi>Peace.</hi> What Iſſue his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will have, is of no great
Import to us, who ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> Sole <hi>Lord</hi> of the
<hi>Four Seas:</hi> But I will tell thee ſomething which it concerns thee to
know.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is a going to cut a <hi>Canal</hi>
through Part of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by which the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> may
be joyn'd to the <hi>Main Sea.</hi> This is a vaſt Deſign, and much
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of in <hi>Europe,</hi> being a Parallel to what has been formerly
attempted by ſome <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to joyn the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Red Sea</hi>
together, for the ſake of an eaſier Traffick to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou oughteſt alſo to be inform'd of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Exploits on the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary.</hi> He is
<hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Navy in thoſe <hi>Seas,</hi> and
has done great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104896:151"/>to the People of <hi>Algier,
Sarcelle, Bougie,</hi> and other <hi>Ports.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> are deſervedly puniſh'd for
deſerting the Protection of the <hi>High Port,</hi> yet let us remember, that
the <hi>Algerines</hi> are <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and therefore ought not to
be abandon'd to the Malice of <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mighty <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſail thou in the Strength of
<hi>God</hi> againſt the Enemies of the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> And when
thou haſt finiſh'd thy Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age here below, may a Wind of Mercy waft thee
o'er the Waters which are above the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi> and land thee ſafe

Death of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Royal Extraction,</hi> and whilſt living not far remov'd from a

Receptacle of all Mortals, and which makes no Diſtinction between the

               </p>
               <p>There have been Abundance of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies perform'd on the Part
of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of

ſhort of the <hi>True Faithful</hi> in believing the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
and <hi>Immortality</hi> to come. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the
<hi>Dead</hi> to their <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> with ſolemn Rites of
<hi>Religion,</hi> perfuming them with <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and ſprinkling
them with <hi>Holy Water;</hi> Rehearſing alſo certain Sacred
<hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> appointed for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Neither do
they neglect to Faſt, and give Alms, to perform any <hi>Pious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
which is practis'd by the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> for their Friends who are
gone to the <hi>Inviſible State.</hi> They agree with us in Abundance of good
things, and if they mix ſome Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Errors, let us pity their
Weakneſs, and praiſe <hi>God</hi> who guides us into the Right Way, and
ſuffers us no to be ſeduced into the Way of <hi>Infidels.</hi> He is the
<hi>Merciful</hi> of the <hi>Merciful,</hi> the <hi>Joy</hi> of the
<hi>Elect,</hi> and the <hi>Hope</hi> of all <hi>Nations.</hi> Should he
puniſh Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Hourly Demerits, the Earth would ſoon be
depopulated, and void of any other Inhabitants ſave the <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
But he knows our Mold, and remembers that we are no more than a mere
<hi>Froth</hi> or <hi>Spume</hi> of the<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104896:153"/>
                  <hi>Elements,</hi>
and that in a very little time, by the Courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi> we ſhall
vaniſh like <hi>Bubbles</hi> which yield to every <hi>Blaſt</hi> of
<hi>Wind.</hi> Therefore he ſpares us, and connives at our Infirmities,
becauſe he is the Lover of <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak this as an Incentive to Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves,
and to our Fellow-Mortals. It ſeems to me unreaſonable, that we ſhould
purſue with Inexorable Hatred all the <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of
<hi>Jeſus.</hi> He was a <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> humble, mild, chaſte, and
harmleſs. He did many Good Works himſelf, and commanded his
<hi>Diſciples</hi> to imitate his Example. He rebuk'd thoſe amongſt them,
that would have call'd down <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to conſume his
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Enjoyning them to return Bleſſings for Curſes, Prayers for
Blaſphemies, and Good for Evil. There are thoſe amongſt them, who obey
his Precepts: As for the Wicked, I am not their Advocate. If the Greateſt
Part of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> live contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> let us conſider alſo how many Hypocrites, Libertines,
Hereticks and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts there are among thoſe who profeſs the
<hi>Muſſulman Faith.</hi> Doubtleſs, there are Good and Bad of all
<hi>Religions.</hi> And 'tis impoſſible to find an Aſſembly of Juſt
Men, without a Mixture of Sinners.</p>
               <p>As for our Difference with the People of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in
Matters of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> it ought not to make us forget that we are Men,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the ſame Fleſh and Blood as they. And for ought we know,
<hi>God</hi> who made all<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104896:154"/>the <hi>Nations</hi> of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> may accept of their various <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> in paying him <hi>Divine Adoration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We that are the <hi>Poſterity</hi> of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and
worſhip the <hi>Eternal</hi> after the manner of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> who
followed the <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> the <hi>Beloved</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> cannot deny but that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was of
<hi>Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:</hi> And yet it contains Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, to
which we are wholly Strangers in our Practice; tho' the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are
the <hi>Deſcendents</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> obey them to this Day.</p>
               <p>So we believe what the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> That he is the <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of
<hi>God;</hi> That he heal'd <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> rais'd the <hi>Dead,</hi>
wrought many other <hi>Miracles,</hi> and preach'd the true Heavenly
<hi>Doctrin.</hi> Yet there's abundance of Difference between the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> which the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> us'd in the Service of
<hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Mahomet</hi>
our <hi>Holy Lawgiver.</hi> But he tells us, That they who live up to the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhall go to <hi>Paradiſe</hi> as well as
the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt Scandal which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> give us,
is their Setting up <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> in their
<hi>Temples,</hi> and the Reverence they pay to thoſe Inſenſible Pieces
of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art. And yet for ought we know, they may be excuſable before
<hi>God;</hi> ſince they profeſs openly in the <hi>Publick Decrees</hi> of
their <hi>Councils,</hi> That the Veneration and Honour they pay to the
<hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:104896:154"/>is only Relative, their <hi>Devotion</hi> at the ſame Time
reſting not on this ſide the <hi>Prototypes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be true, I ſee no more Hurt in their Worſhip of
<hi>Images,</hi> than in Bowing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating before the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
which is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sort of <hi>Imagery</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Divine
Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, if the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Egyptians</hi> are allow'd to be Lawful Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Inſtruments to
expreſs the Inward Conceptions of the Mind; in my Opinion, the Painting and
Sculpture which we ſee in the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
ought not to be condemn'd as an Idolotrous Practice, when 'tis only us'd as an
eaſier way to convey the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the
reſt of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> to the Vulgar, who are
generally Ignorant of <hi>Letters.</hi> Unleſs we ſhall ſay, That the
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> was an <hi>Idol,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>
and <hi>Saints</hi> were <hi>Devils;</hi> which <hi>God</hi> avert from the
Mouth of a <hi>True Believer.</hi>

               <p>ACcording to thy Deſire, I have procur'd and ſent thee the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> with other <hi>Writings</hi> of our <hi>Holy Doctors;
Books</hi> which will conduct thee into the Right Way Thou wilt find in theſe
<hi>Volumes,</hi> a Spirit of Life and Power. There breathes in them a certain
Vital Principle of Reaſon; ſo that whoſoever reads them attentively, may
feel (if I may ſo ſpeak) the very Pulſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Wiſdom,

applauded <hi>Talmud,</hi> and not feel himſelf touch'd with Horrour, at the
Monſtrous Blaſphemies and Ridiculous Forgeries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contain'd? Doſt
thou not laugh at the Story of <hi>God</hi>'s pickling up the
<hi>Leviathan</hi> till the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and that other of
the <hi>Bull</hi> which daily devours the Fodder of<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104896:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>a Thouſand Mountains? Or wilt thou ſhew me the Neſt of that

Earth, threw down Three Hundred tall Cedars with its Weight, and at Length
breaking, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow'd Sixty Villages with the Liquid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance included in

               <p>Such as theſe, muſt needs be fit Themes for the

that <hi>God</hi> ſtudies Nine Hours of the Day in the <hi>Talmud.</hi> Can
any Man of common Piety, hear theſe Blaſphemies and not tremble? What

               </p>
               <p>Tell me, <hi>Nathan,</hi> canſt thou ſwallow that loud Lye

when he roar'd at the Diſtance of Four Hundred Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> all
the Women that were with Child in that City, being affrighted at the Noiſe,
miſcarry'd, and the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> fell down? And when he drew nearer

ſwallow'd a <hi>Serpent</hi> that had eaten a <hi>Frog</hi> as big as a
Village of Threeſcore Houſes, and when he had done flew into the next Tree.
I ſuppoſe, that was the Tree which grew in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and was
Five Hundred Miles high, according to the <hi>Talmud.</hi> Have I not Reaſon
for this Raillery, when one of your <hi>Rabbi's</hi> ſolemnly ſwears, he
was an Eye-Witneſs of theſe Things? Who can forbear to ridicule the Bigotry
of thoſe, who give up their Faith to ſuch Deluſions?</p>
               <p>Thou wilt meet with more Rational En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in the
<hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctors;</hi> more eſpecially, in
that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript thou haſt of the <hi>Volume</hi> firſt dictated in
<hi>Heaven.</hi> That confirms the true <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but
damns the <hi>Impoſtures</hi> of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> attributing the
Invention of ſuch Errors to the <hi>Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ask me, perhaps, what I mean by the <hi>True
Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Shall I tell thee the Opinion of one of thy own
<hi>Nation,</hi> a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as he pretends;
and for ought I know, of the ſame <hi>Tribe</hi> with thy ſelf: For I am a
Stranger to the <hi>Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of you both.</p>
               <p>Some Years ago here was in this City, a Man who if we may
believe him, has been in all the Cities of the World. The <hi>French</hi> 
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:104896:159"/>call him the <hi>Wandring Jew;</hi> and he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Title, by the Profeſſion he made of his Birth, Deſcent, and
Univerſal Travels. No doubt but thou haſt heard of this Man, or at leaſt
of ſuch a Character, and therefore I need not repeat what he ſaid of
himſelf, and what the Generality of Mankind believe of him. Suffice it to
tell thee, that I was once in his Company half a Day together; when among other
Diſcourſes, he told me, That the <hi>true Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> has
been loſt for above theſe Two Thouſand Years, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the
<hi>North</hi> Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where there are an Infinite Number of
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> but far different in their <hi>Religion,</hi> from all the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the reſt of the World. He ſays, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where they
Inhabit, is environ'd round with High and Inacceſſible Mountains. I ask'd
him the exact <hi>Geographical</hi> Situation of this Country; but receiv'd no
other Anſwer, than that it lay beyond the River <hi>Sabbation.</hi> Then I
remembred what I had read in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> a <hi>Scribe</hi> of thy
<hi>Nation,</hi> concerning the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of the Ten <hi>Tribes,</hi>
who were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captives by the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi> How they
paſs'd through a certain River on dry Ground, the Waters being divided to the
Right Hand and to the Left, and that after the ſame manner they ſhould
return again in the Latter Days; But that in the mean time the <hi>Region</hi>
where they live, was hidden from all other Mortals.</p>
               <p>Comparing this Paſſage with what I had heard from the
<hi>Wandring Jew,</hi> I became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104896:160"/>perſwaded,
That the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> of which he ſpoke, were the
very ſame mention'd by <hi>Eſdras. God</hi> only can diſcern the Truth
from Error in <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and Ancient a Subject.</p>
               <p>As to their Religion, I was juſt going to give thee an Account
of what he ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, but am interrupted by Company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore
I am forc'd to break off abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Expect a full Relation in my next. I am in

               </p>
               <p>I was about to relate what the <hi>Wandring Jew</hi> told me of
the <hi>Religion</hi> of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Hebrews</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
which take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>He ſays, they are a <hi>Nation</hi> of
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> bound by their <hi>Laws</hi> to Study the <hi>Liberal
Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi> They have none but Iron Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny current among
them; the Uſe of Gold and Silver Coins being expreſly forbidden by their
<hi>Laws</hi> to prevent the Temptations of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Theft: For who would
ſteal or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet a Metal, which for its Bulk was not eaſy to be hid, nor for
its Beauty very deſirable, being every where common in the Veins of the Earth
and ſerv'd only as a Method of Barter and Commerce among themſelves, where
the Inequality of Merchandiſes entangled their Traffick, and would not admit
of a ready Exchange?</p>
               <p>This took from them the Occaſion of many unneceſſary Arts
at Home, and they had no Temptation to travel abroad; The Chief Deſign of
their <hi>Lawgiver</hi> being to<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104896:161"/>oblige them to ſpend
moſt of their time in <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi>
Exerciſes, and the reſt in preparing Neceſſaries for humane
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance. They had no Need to buy any thing of Foreign <hi>Countries,</hi>
or to build Ships for that End, who were bound to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the
Natural Product of their own Fertile <hi>Country:</hi> For Luxury has not as

Traveller. He ſays, they feed altogether on the Fruits of the Earth; not
admitting any Art or Employment which tends to ſuperfluity; but only ſuch
as ſerve the neceſſary Uſes of Life, wherein they ſhew an admirable
Dexterity and Skill.</p>
               <p>When they travel from one Town to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is very
frequent, they never carry any thing to defray their Charges by the Way, or
when they arrive at their Journeys End: All Entertainments of this Nature being
free and reciprocal. Such is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have no <hi>Lawyers</hi> among them, but if any Contention
ariſe, 'tis preſently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the Arbitration of the next
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to whoſe Sentence all ſubmit: Every Man being willing to
loſe ſomething of his Right, rather than diſturb the Publick Amity and
Peace.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of their <hi>Worſhip,</hi> they are ſtrict
Obſervers of Purity in waſhing, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhaving their Bodies.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Temples</hi> alſo where they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every

Banquet together with Joy, whilſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> entertain them with
excellent Muſick, and Songs, in Praiſe of <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Works.</hi> To this End the Courts of their <hi>Temples</hi> are made very

Pavillions are ſet up, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with the Boughs of Green Trees, with all

they are not permitted to taſte of Fleſh. They eat only the Fruits of the

               <p>At the Age of Sixteen Years, every Man is bound to take the

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are all the Terms of the <hi>Oath,</hi> that I can

               <p>One would think, that theſe were the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity</hi> of

<hi>Salmanaſar</hi> King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria.</hi> And this was alſo the

                  <hi>Language</hi> wherein it is written. For he ſaid, it was rather

<hi>God</hi> wrote the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> on the <hi>Two Tables:</hi>
Among which one is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition they
ſay, extends to all <hi>Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> tho' your <hi>Doctors</hi>
interpret it as only reaching to <hi>Men,</hi> and ſo do the
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> interpret it thus,
<hi>Thou ſhalt neither kill Man nor Beaſt without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> By which
Clauſe, the <hi>Beaſts</hi> are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd from the wanton Cruelty of
Men, who otherwiſe would murder them only to make Sport; yet wicked
<hi>Men</hi> are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from a violent Death, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
their Crimes.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Traveller</hi> ſays alſo, that the <hi>People</hi>
of that <hi>Country</hi> are ſo healthy that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally live till they
are a Hundred and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years old, which is almoſt twice the Age of other
Mortals. This he aſcribes to their exquiſite Temperance and Moderation in
all things, as alſo to the Dryneſs of the Soil, and to the Force of certain
Winds, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſweep the Air of this delectable Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and purge
it of all hurtful Qualities.</p>
               <p>If ever it be thy Fortune to ſee this Perſon, he will
acquaint thee with a great many more delightful Paſſages, which it would be
too tedious for me to inſert in a Letter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, my Memory is
treacherous, and I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forget thoſe things at one time, which I remember
at another: But if thou art ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to hear more, I will oblige thee
with<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104896:163"/>all that I can call to mind of this
<hi>Traveller</hi> in another Letter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, make a right Uſe of theſe Hints, and weigh
one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; examine all things without Prejudice or Partiality.
Truſt no Man's Reaſon but thy own in Matters of a diſputable Nature,
ſince thou haſt as much right to decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, as any Man. And
thus thou wilt never become a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi>

has counterpois'd Vice in the Courſe of this Mortal Life. However, I am
reſign'd, and commit my ſelf to the <hi>Indulgent Creator</hi> of <hi>all
Things,</hi> who will not fail to diſpoſe of me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order
which he has eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:104896:164"/>Methinks were I even in <hi>Hell,</hi> I
cou'd not forbear praiſing that <hi>Fountain of all Things.</hi> I wou'd
teach the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damn'd</hi> a new Leſſon of Patience and
Contentedneſs, of Humility and Devotion, of Generoſity and Love, amidſt
their Tremendous Torments. I wou'd ſurvey with an Indifference becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
<hi>True Believer,</hi> the Horrid <hi>Abyſs,</hi> with all its dreadful
Vaults and Apartments. I wou'd conſider the Wonderful Architecture of thoſe
Infernal Priſons, the inexpugnable Strength of the Walls; their Prodigious
Thickneſs and unmoveable Faſtneſs; I wou'd contemplate every Thing with
the Reaſon of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and the Piety of a
<hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> not giving my ſelf up to the Paſſions of a Fool,
and an <hi>Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this I imagine were eaſy to perform in thoſe Fatal
Caverns and much more, but <hi>God</hi> knows how the Experience of ſuch an
Intolerable Anguiſh and Reſtraint, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Man's Mind.</p>
               <p>However, I find it <hi>Medicinal</hi> to think of the laſt and
worſt Things, to be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for Death, and whatſoever ſhall
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; For, Surprizes are apt to unman us, and plunder us of our Reaſon.
I was in the Heighth of a violent Fever, when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this Letter; yet now
'tis abated, and I palpably feel the gentle Returns of Health and Life. This is
owing, in my Judgment, to the real Belief I had, that my laſt Hour was come,
which I have ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. And I cou'd almoſt perſwade my 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:104896:164"/>ſelf, That I ſhall diſperſe a Thouſand
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,</hi> recover out of the moſt dangerous <hi>Paroxyſms,</hi>
and prolong my Days to Old Age, by the mere Force of theſe
Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.</p>
               <p>My Faith in this Point is grounded on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For, I have
often found, That to be arm'd againſt Calamities with an even Mind, is either
a ſure Way to avoid them, or at leaſt to protract the Seaſon of their
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. And, if there were nothing elſe in't, but the rendring 'em more
eaſy when they come, 'twere worth any Man's Pains to try the Experiment.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, there is no Terrour in Death, but what the vain
Opinion of Men creates. 'Tis as pleaſant for a Thinking Man to die as to
live, if it be only for this Reaſon, that in his Paſſage from the Life he
has lead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſhall not have bare naked <hi>Idea's</hi> for his
Contemplation; but Matter of Fact, and the moſt Important, that ever employ'd
the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>O Admirable <hi>Sylvan,</hi> conſider with thy ſelf, whether
it will not be highly grateful to thy languiſhing Soul, when thou ſhalt
perceive demonſtratively, by the Infallible <hi>Enthymema's</hi> of thy
trembling Pulſe, that thou art juſt ready to be releas'd from the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Sophiſtry of Humane Life! That thou art near eſcaping from a
narrow Cage to be upon the Wing at large, to fly into the Ample Fields of
Beauty, Light and End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Happineſs: Reflect alſo at the ſame 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104896:165"/>Time, O Holy <hi>Eremite,</hi> that I ſhou'd think it
no Pain to be freed from my Confinement to a ſtinking Neſt of
<hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why ſhou'd I give them that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Epithet, when for
ought I know, I am a greater <hi>Infidel</hi> my ſelf? 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I
am of the Lineage of <hi>Ibrahim, Iſmael,</hi> and the Holy Race; I bear in
my Body the <hi>Seas</hi> of a <hi>Divine League</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and Man; I was <hi>circumcis'd</hi> in due Time, and gave
Supreme Glory to <hi>One God,</hi> and Honour to <hi>Mahomet</hi> his

the very Breath with which that Sacred Confeſſion is utter'd, blows the
Aſhes of <hi>Hell</hi> into the Eyes of the <hi>Damn'd,</hi> and ſtrikes
'em blind. In a Word, I have faſted, pray'd, given Alms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd all
the External Duties of a <hi>True Believer,</hi> yet I have Reaſon to fear,
that the beſt of my pious Actions are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cancel my Sins. My
Practice runs counter to my Faith, there ſeems to be a double Spirit in me,
one inclining me to Good, and the other forcing me to Evil. For, whilſt I
really in my Heart believe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and obey <hi>Mahomet,</hi> our
<hi>Holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> I am compell'd to deny both, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Life
and Manners of a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> to counterfeit an <hi>Infidel,</hi> and do
a Thouſand<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104896:165"/>other ill things, to pleaſe the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> and his Slaves Thus I play faſt and looſe with <hi>God
Almighty;</hi> and turn <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Croſs Purpoſes.</hi> Yet
<hi>Heaven</hi> knows, and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all the Elements to Witneſs, that I
wou'd fain be Innocent, and live in unblemiſh'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: But the Fatal
Neceſſities I lie under, conſtrain me to a perpetual Courſe of Vice.
Which makes me ſometimes cry out in the Agonies of my Soul, O <hi>God! I pray
thee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to alter my Circumſtances, and reform my Nature, or make new
Laws more eaſy to be kept.</hi>

               <p>THou mayſt report it to the <hi>Divan</hi> for a Certainty,
That <hi>Mirammud</hi> the Son of the <hi>Xariph</hi> of <hi>Salle,</hi> is
taken Priſoner by the <hi>French.</hi> That bold Youth has long rov'd the
Seas uncontroul'd; has done many Injuries to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> fill'd
<hi>Salle</hi> with <hi>Slaves:</hi> Now he himſelf is become a
<hi>Captive.</hi> Such is the Fortune of War by Sea and Land; to Day Triumphant
and Victorious, to Morrow Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd and in Chains.</p>
               <p>Yet he loſt not his <hi>Honour</hi> with his <hi>Liberty,</hi>
having bravely defended his Veſſel, and ſtrew'd the Decks with
ſlaughter'd <hi>French;</hi> till overpower'd with Numbers, he was compell'd
to yield. His Enemies extol his Courage, and the Greatneſs of his Mind, which
would not ſink under the Preſſure of this Misfortune. He ſeem'd to have
the Command of himſelf, (which is the moſt Glorious Victory) and ſuffer'd
not his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Soul, to be led Captive by his Paſſions; but behav'd
himſelf with ſuch an even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as plac'd him above the Pity of his
Enemies, and rather made him the Subject of their Emulation. He is brought to

                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:104896:166"/>rather than as a <hi>Priſoner:</hi> Being invited to
their Banquets, Masks, Plays, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements. Neither is he
debarr'd the Privilege of Hunting, which might give him the faireſt
Opportunity to eſcape. But he is ignorant of the <hi>Language</hi> of this
Country; and few of the <hi>French</hi> underſtand <hi>Moreſco:</hi> So
that it is almoſt impoſſible for him to make any Party, or conſult his
Flight, unleſs the King's Interpreter ſhould aſſiſt him. Beſides,
the <hi>French</hi> have a higher Opinion of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, than to
apprehend ſuch an Ingrateful Return of the <hi>Royal</hi> Uſage he finds in
this <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mahmut,</hi> he has not as yet made himſelf known

<hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> with ſome <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> within

<hi>Solyman</hi>'s Perfidy: For theſe <hi>Furr'd-Caps</hi> are his Spies and
Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. The Back-Blows of <hi>Tagot, Negidher,</hi> and the <hi>Great

               <p>They came firſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Merchants;</hi> and

               <p>Age and much Sickneſs have confin'd me to my Bed for a
conſiderable time, which is no ſmall Alloy to Human Happineſs. But to
render me perfectly miſerable, the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of the <hi>Port</hi>
are angry with me for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Old and Infirm, and for not continuing to ſerve
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> with the ſame Vigour and Strength as formerly:
Elſe what mean the frequent Reproaches they ſend me whilſt I am not in a
Condition to anſwer them, or make an Apology for my ſelf? 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:104896:170"/>Would they have me Immortal, and Proof againſt the
ſtrokes of Deſtiny and Death, which thou know'ſt are Unavoidable?
Whilſt I were in my Prime, Healthy and ſtrong as an Eagle, they encourag'd
me with the faireſt Promiſes in the World, telling me I ſhould never want
for Mony, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Yet even then I
receiv'd not my <hi>Penſion</hi> without Murmurs and obſcure Menaces. So
hard a thing is it for <hi>Courtiers</hi> to be touch'd with any Man's
Neceſſities. But now they threaten plainly to ſtop all farther Supplies,
unleſs I will grow Young again, and do Buſineſs as brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as when I'd
number'd but Thirty <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi> Thus they ſerve poor <hi>Mahmut,</hi>
as we uſe Oranges and Limons, whoſe vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when we have ſuck'd
out, we throw the reſt away as unprofitable. Yet not one of them will
contribute in the leaſt to my Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Only the generous <hi>Cara
Hali,</hi> our beloved Friend, hearing of my Malady, ſent me a ſtrange
<hi>Chymical</hi> Liquor, with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Confection El Razi,</hi>
ſome <hi>Bezoar,</hi> and the moſt precious <hi>Balm</hi> of
<hi>Gilead:</hi> All prepar'd to my Hand, with Directions, and leal'd with an
Authentick <hi>Signet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe indeed had a marvellous Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on me. I tried them
but Yeſterday, and find my ſelf ſuddenly reſtor'd to ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of
Health, as by a Miracle. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the vaſt Eſteem I have for that
Excellent <hi>Phyſician,</hi> with the Confidence I repoſe in his Skill and
Judgment, has had<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104896:171"/>ſome Influence on me, or what elſe I
know not; (yet, we uſe to obſerve, that the <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>'s good
Opinion of his <hi>Phyſicians</hi> is half a Cure:) However, theſe
Sovereign Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines have inſpir'd me with a new Energy. And had I not other
Afflictions to break my Heart, I cou'd almoſt promiſe my ſelf to reach
the Age of <hi>Neſtor.</hi> But my <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Stars</hi> will have it
otherwiſe, and I am reſign'd to <hi>Deſtiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou know'ſt my Couſin <hi>Solyman,</hi> the
<hi>Turbant</hi>-Maker, and art no Stranger to his Humours and Fortune: What an
unſetled Man he has been in the whole Courſe of his Life: That no
Employment cou'd ever pleaſe him, nor he be long fix'd in any Place. How he
has rambl'd from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to <hi>Scutari,</hi> from thence to
<hi>Chalcedon &amp;c.</hi> Always murmuring againſt <hi>Heaven</hi> and
complaining of his hard Fate, in that he was not bred a Courtier, a Student, a
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier or any Thing but what he really is Thou art acquainted alſo with
ſome of his Religious Caprices, how he is addicted to <hi>doing the
Book,</hi> making the <hi>Triple Knot,</hi> and to a Thouſand other fooliſh
Superſtitions by which whilſt he aſpires at the Character of a Sage, or a
Cunning Man, he renders himſelf more Contemptible than an Ideot; forfeiting
the Eſteem of all wiſe and good Men, for the Sake of a little Fame and
noiſy Character among the Empty, Giddy Multitude</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:104896:171"/>But after all, I believe thou art wholly a
Stranger to his Secret Malice, and the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour with which he perſecuted me,
his poor Exil'd Uncle. I my ſelf was deceiv'd by the Subtle Apology he made
ſome Years ago for the Slanders his Tongue had utter'd; when he transferr'd
all the Guilt of that Injury on <hi>Shaſhim Iſtham,</hi> the <hi>Black
Eunuch,</hi> and <hi>Ichingi Cap Oglani, Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Pages.</hi>
But now I'm convinc'd he's a Traytor, a Villain, and a Fellow void of Faith or
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p>I receiv'd a Letter from him within theſe ſeven Days, full
of Tender and Inſinuating Expreſſions, thanking me for all the good
Offices I had done him, and for my ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counſel in ſeveral
Caſes. Profeſſing alſo at the ſame time an Inviolable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and that he would make it his Study to do me ſome Effectual Service. Yet the
next <hi>Poſt</hi> brought me a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> from my Brother
<hi>Peſteli Hali,</hi> wherein he bids me beware of <hi>Solyman;</hi>
aſſuring me that he had good Reaſon to ſuſpect, that
<hi>Couſin</hi> of mine had ſome ill Deſign upon me. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſays my Brother, <hi>Solyman</hi> boaſts to his Familiars not without
ſome Inſult, that there is not a Word or Action eſcapes his Uncle
<hi>Mahmut</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> but he is ſoon inform'd of it at
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And that which confirms me in the ſame Jealouſy
with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteli</hi> is, That he inſerts in his Letter to me, ſome
Paſſages and Diſcourſes <hi>Verbatim,</hi> which I muſt needs own to
have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<pb n="312" facs="tcp:104896:172"/>me and <hi>Eliachim</hi> the
<hi>Jew,</hi> with two or three <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants, in our moſt
private Meetings at <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Houſe or my Chamber. Theſe he
learnt from ſome of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s moſt Intimate Companions.</p>
               <p>What can I make of all this, but that theſe <hi>Armenians</hi>
are of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Council, his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado's,</hi> his
<hi>Chronee's,</hi> &amp;c. whom having Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their own at
<hi>Paris,</hi> that perfidious Wretch has engag'd to pry into my Secrets, to
give him a conſtant Account of what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries they make, and if
poſſible to tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan me into ſome Irrecoverable Error in my Conduct, that
ſo he may finally ruin me.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Mahomet!</hi> What is become of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to thy
<hi>Sacred Name,</hi> to thy <hi>Law,</hi> and to the <hi>Book</hi> penn'd in
<hi>Heaven?</hi> Where is the <hi>Muſſulman Faith</hi> and
<hi>Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> The Religious Faſtneſs of Friendſhip, with which our
Fathers prop'd up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Service of <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>True Believers?</hi> But there is no need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
againſt <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: Humane Nature it

Kinſman. He no longer deſerves the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Man. I adviſe thee to
ſhun his Company as a Peſt, a walking Contagion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mortals.</p>
               <p>In a word, dear <hi>Dgnet,</hi> let not thou and I ſuffer our

               </head>
               <p>THou and thy feigned <hi>Meſſias</hi> be damn'd together for
Company! Muſt I be baulkt of my Money, for the Sake of your New
<hi>Superſtition?</hi> How many <hi>Meſſias's</hi> have ye had, Twenty
Five at leaſt, beſides the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> who is

Debaucheries of Mortals. <hi>Nathan,</hi> I took thee for another Manner of
Man. However, if thou art a Sworn Servant to <hi>Sabbati Sevi,</hi> the new
<hi>Sham-King</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to it: Do as
thou wilt. But, I dare be a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſo far as to tell thee, thou
wilt be curſedly left in the Lurch, with the Reſt of the Fools, thy
Bigotted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Let what will be, it behoves thee as an honeſt Man to
tranſmit the Bills that are entruſted to thee. Whether <hi>Sabbati Sevi,
Ben Joſeph</hi> or <hi>Ben David</hi> be the Name of your expected

<hi>Tophet,</hi> which you pleaſe. But I wou'd fain have thee in the Number
of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> who ſhall poſſeſs <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Some
of thy Letters have encourag'd me to hope for this, but thy laſt makes me
almoſt deſpair of ſeeing thee happy either in <hi>This</hi> World or the

               <p>For <hi>God</hi>'s Sake, <hi>Nathan,</hi> wean thy ſelf from
theſe Religious Fondneſſes: Awaken thy Reaſon, which is the
diſtinguiſhnig Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Man. Examine the Grounds of this New
Deluſion; ſearch into the Birth and Origin of <hi>Sabbati Sevi,</hi> and
thou wilt find him to deſcend of an Obſcure and Baſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage; his
Father being but a Kind of Mungrel <hi>Jew,</hi> and by Profeſſion an

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> which is forbid by the <hi>Written Law</hi> of

Execrable: His Mother a Woman of the <hi>Curds,</hi> ſuſpected for a
<hi>Witch,</hi> in Regard, moſt of that Infidel Nation practiſe Magick
Arts, and Diabolical Charms. And 'tis not altogether improbable, that your
Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Meſſias</hi> was educated privately by her in the ſame
Studies, whence he learn'd the<pb n="319" facs="tcp:104896:175"/>Methods of Enchantments and
Illuſions, to deceive the Senſes and impoſe on the Reaſon of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>I can tell thee of a Truth, that there are more Eyes on him and
his Actions, than he is aware of; and I my ſelf at this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance have
receiv'd a particular Relation of his Life, from ſuch as knew him a Youth at
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Place of his Nativity. He is accus'd of many Vices and
Extravagances during his early Years. His Converſation was wild and
diſſolute, being a noted <hi>Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morato</hi> or <hi>Stallion</hi> over all
that City. For which and ſome other Crimes, he was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the
<hi>Synagogue,</hi> and baniſh'd from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by the Mutual
Conſent of the <hi>Muſſulman Cadi,</hi> and your own <hi>Rulers.</hi> He
was alſo excommunicated by the <hi>Rabbi's</hi> as a <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> for
broaching certain <hi>Doctrins</hi> repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to your <hi>Law,</hi> and the
General <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> All which cannot but be a
prevailing Recommendation of him to the Office of <hi>Meſſias</hi> or
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence he rambled up and down the <hi>Morea</hi> and other
<hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Memorial of Infamy,
where-ever he ſet his Foot; continually marrying and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcing of Wives,
debauching of Virgins, and frequenting the Company of Harlots, till thoſe
Countries grew weary of him, and threatn'd to chaſtiſe his Wickedneſs.
Then he paſs'd over into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to ſet up for a Reformer of your<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104896:176"/>
                  <hi>Law,</hi> and at
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> openly profeſſing himſelf to be the
<hi>Meſſias;</hi> whereby he drew a Rabble of Lunaticks and Frantick People
after him. But as for the <hi>Seniors</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> they have

<hi>Star,</hi> who pretended to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the Days of
<hi>Adrian, Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> Reflect on the Calamities
which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd him and his Followers, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Four Hundred
Thouſand <hi>Jews;</hi> who all fell with their <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi>
Sacrifices to the juſt Revenge and Fury of that Incens'd <hi>Monarch:</hi>
For they had impudently boaſted that by ſuch a prefix'd time, he ſhould
be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Captive and depos'd from his Throne by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who
ſhould aſſume the <hi>Imperial</hi> Dignity, and all the World ſhould
obey him. But when thoſe who ſurviv'd the Slaughter of their Brethren,
reflected on the Author of ſo Tragical a <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> they chang'd
his Name in Contempt and Hatred, calling him no longer <hi>Ben Cochab,</hi> the
<hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>Star,</hi> but <hi>Bar Cuziba,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of a
<hi>Lye,</hi> a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> and Seducer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt all the Reaſon in the World, to have no better
Opinion of <hi>Sabbati Sevi,</hi> ſince he is rejected by the Wiſer Sort of
<hi>Jews,</hi> and has not perform'd one Miracle in Confirmation of his
pretended <hi>Meſſias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:104896:176"/>Neither has any
uncommon or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Appearance happen'd before or ſince he aſſum'd
this Dignity. Whereas all your <hi>Rabbi's</hi> teach, that no leſs than Ten
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Remarkable Prodigies ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Coming of your
<hi>Meſſias.</hi> And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thou thy ſelf about Ten Years ago
ſenteſt me a Letter much to the ſame Effect, telling me that certain
Monſtrous Sorts of Men ſhould come from the Ends of the Earth, whoſe Eyes
ſhall be as Venomous as <hi>Baſilisks,</hi> with a great many other Stories
of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou forgot this, <hi>Nathan,</hi> or art thou ſo far

               <p>I Am afraid the <hi>Divan</hi> will be oblig'd to ſend another
<hi>Agent</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to ſupply the Place of <hi>Nathan Ben
Saddi,</hi> who is running mad after the New <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> There is no doubt but thou and the other Happy
<hi>Miniſters,</hi> reſiding at the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Port,</hi> have heard of
a certain <hi>Impoſtor</hi> at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by Name <hi>Sabbati
Sevi,</hi> of <hi>Hebrew Race,</hi> who calls himſelf the <hi>Only begotten
Son of God, Meſſias</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and
what Multitudes of doting Credulous <hi>Jews</hi> he draws after him. So that
there is a <hi>Schiſm</hi> broke out between them, and they are divided into
Two contrary Factions both in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and all over the
<hi>Levant.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that theſe things ſhould be
conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Reſplendent Seat</hi> of <hi>Fame,</hi> ſince they
have reach'd even our Ears who dwell at this Diſtance: Nay there is hardly a
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> or <hi>City</hi> in all the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which has not
receiv'd Intelligence of ſo Remarkable a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</p>
               <p>I have receiv'd a Diſpatch from <hi>Zeidi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanzi</hi> at
<hi>Venice,</hi> wherein he informs me, that all the <hi>Jews</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> are preparing to viſit the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and to ſee
the Face of their long expected <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who they now 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104896:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>believe is really come on Earth, and is that
<hi>Sabbati Sevi,</hi> at <hi>Smyrna.</hi> They are ſettling their Affairs,
as faſt as they can, acquitting themſelves from all Worldly Engagements,
and thoſe who are devout, give themſelves up to Prayer and Mortifications;
whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpend their time in Feaſting, Dancing, and all manner of
Mirth. He ſays, ſome of them will ſit or ſtand up to the Noſe in
Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for Four and Twenty Hours together. And this they do in Imitation of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, according to their <hi>Tradition:</hi> For they are
taught, that the <hi>Firſt Father</hi> of Mortals, after he was baniſh'd
from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for his Sin, ſtood a Hundred and
Thirty Years together in Water thus reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Noſtrils.</p>
               <p>Others of theſe Superſtitious People, will ſit naked many
Hours together on a Heap of <hi>Piſmires,</hi> till they're almoſt ſtung
to Death. A third Sort dig their own Graves, and going down into them, cauſe
themſelves to be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all over with Earth, except only their Faces; and
in this Condition they will lie till they are almoſt famiſh'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, they ſend Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from all Parts,
congratulating each others approaching Happineſs and Deliverance from the
Oppreſſion of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For ſo they term all that are not of
their own <hi>Nation.</hi> And in theſe mutual Addreſſes, they fail not
to Propheſy, That their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall in ſuch a
<hi>Moon,</hi> go to the <hi>Great Tyrant, King</hi> of the
<hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of all the <hi>Children</hi> of 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104896:178"/>
                  <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Edom;</hi> (So they blaſpheme our
Glorious <hi>Sultan.</hi>) That he ſhall depoſe him from his
<hi>Throne,</hi> and lead him away Captive; after which he ſhall have the
Dominions of the whole Earth laid at his Feet.</p>
               <p>With ſuch kind of wild Stuff, do theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People
flatter one another and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if in a little time they were to be
<hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>all Things.</hi> So that no Trading or Commerce goes
forward among them: An Univerſal Stop is put to all Buſineſs; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eſteem'd an Inexpiable Sin, to follow their Trades in the Days of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is to enrich them with the Wealth of all
<hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strange Rumours are ſpread abroad, of the Return of the
<hi>Ten Tribes</hi> over the River <hi>Sabbation,</hi> who were carried away
Captives by <hi>Salmanaſſar King</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and never
were heard of ſince, till they now diſcourſe of their being encamp'd in
the <hi>Deſart</hi> of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> in their March to the <hi>Holy
Land.</hi> 'Tis reported alſo, that a Mighty Fleet of Ships were ſeen at
Sea, whoſe Sails were of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and their Streamers bore the Figure
of a Lyon, with this Inſcription, <hi>The Lyon of the Tribe of

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeem aſtoniſh'd at theſe

<hi>Eliachim</hi> here, he is no more mov'd at theſe things than I; only he

               </head>
               <p>THis has been a Conſiderable Year of Actions and Events. At
the Beginning of it, I ſent to the <hi>Port</hi> an Account of the Death of
the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and of the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Conti:</hi> now I will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inform thee of a <hi>War</hi> that is broke
out between this <hi>Crown</hi> and that of <hi>England.</hi> The Occaſion of
it was this: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> trafficking in
<hi>America,</hi> had ſome Miſunderſtandings and Feuds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Limits
of their ſeveral Conqueſts in thoſe Remote Parts of the <hi>World.</hi>
The <hi>Hollanders</hi> being the ſtrongeſt, did many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to their
Neighbours the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and domineer'd over them as their
<hi>Lords.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſenting this very heinouſly, and
grown weary of their Oppreſſions, ſent Complaints to their <hi>King.</hi>
He to redreſs his <hi>Subjects</hi> order'd his Reſident at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> to demand Satisfaction of the <hi>States.</hi> They refus'd to
do him that Juſtice; upon which he was reſolv'd to have Recourſe to his
Arms, and accordingly proclaim'd <hi>War</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Holland;</hi>
making all neceſſary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to carry it on. The ſame did his
Adverſaries. The <hi>French King</hi> in the mean time was oblig'd by a
<hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:104896:180"/>concluded in
the Year 1662. to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe their Quarrels; yet that he might not break with
<hi>England</hi> raſhly, he firſt ſent an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> to that
<hi>Court</hi> to mediate a <hi>Peace.</hi> But that proving Ineffectual, he
proclaim'd a <hi>War</hi> againſt that <hi>Nation,</hi> and commanded the
<hi>Engliſh Embaſſador</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> The
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who is <hi>Admiral</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi>
was order'd to Equip a Gallant <hi>Fleet,</hi> and joyn the
<hi>Dutch-Navy;</hi> Which he perform'd with all Imaginable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and
Expedition. There has been Two Combats between theſe Enemies at Sea, and in
both the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the worſt of it: Neither did the <hi>French</hi>
eſcape without ſome Loſs, having Two of their Greateſt Ships
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely ſhatter'd, and a Third taken by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> ſtill rages in <hi>England,</hi> and has
almoſt depopulated whole <hi>Provinces.</hi> Whilſt a milder Death has
robb'd <hi>France</hi> of one of her Greateſt <hi>Heroes:</hi> The <hi>Count
d' Harcourt,</hi> of whom I have often made mention, is gone to celebrate the
Triumphs due to his Valour and Fortune in another <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> has at laſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> after abundance of Demurrs and
Heſitations about that Buſineſs. Theſe <hi>Nazarenes</hi> can do
nothing with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. The <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> as they call them,
have more Tricks and Cramp Words to amuze People with, than an <hi>Indian
Mountebank</hi> or <hi>Juggler.</hi> Neither are <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes</hi>
more exempt from their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104896:180"/>than the meaneſt
of their Subjects. Eſpecially the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> can make
or annul Marriages at Pleaſure. And they are ſure to be Excommunicated, who
refuſe to ſubmit to their Orders. This <hi>Holy Court</hi> can alſo bind
or releaſe <hi>Sins,</hi> open or ſhut the <hi>Gates</hi> of
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> make a <hi>Devil</hi> a <hi>Saint,</hi> or a
<hi>Saint</hi> a <hi>Devil.</hi> In a word, they can do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing if there
be Gold in the Caſe. But if that be wanting they can do nothing but ſhrug
their Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt alſo inform the <hi>Divan,</hi> that the
<hi>French King</hi> has given Permiſſion to ſome of his
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to undertake a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and
eſtabliſh a Commerce in that <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Many
Veſſels are equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Order to this Expedition, and they that are
concern'd in the Voyage, are as merry as <hi>Jaſon</hi> and his
<hi>Argonauts,</hi> when they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to fetch the <hi>Golden
Fleece</hi> from <hi>Colchos.</hi> That <hi>Weſtern Continent</hi> affords
immenſe Riches, and tempts all the <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to
make an Experiment of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in gaining one Part of it or other.
'Twere to be wiſh'd it lay nearer to the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire.</hi> No Record
can diſcover the <hi>Origin</hi> of the <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> Yet moſt
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> conjecture, that they paſs'd over from the <hi>North-Eaſt
Parts</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Anian,</hi>
are very Narrow, and would invite Sea-faring Men to ſeek New Adventures.
Beſides, by their being <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> it appears very probable, That
either<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104896:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>they deſcended from the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
or the <hi>Tartars</hi> from them. <hi>God</hi> alone knows how to adjuſt the
Differences, and reveal the Secrets of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:104896:182"/>It will be of particular Import to thee,
to hear of a Tragical Event that has lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to <hi>Rezan,</hi> a
Great City in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> by the blowing up of the <hi>Magazine.</hi>
This <hi>Gunpowder</hi> does more Miſchief than Good in the <hi>World.</hi>
The <hi>Ancients</hi> fought as ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with Bows and Arrows,
Swords, Spears and other Inſtruments of <hi>War,</hi> without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the
Hazard of blowing up whole Cities into the Air, in time of <hi>Peace.</hi> And
they could undermine the ſtrongeſt Caſtles, even thoſe ſituated on
Rocks, without the help of this <hi>Infernal Duſt. Nature</hi> taught 'em to
be Induſtrious in defeating their Enemies, and they ſpared no Labour to
gain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Our <hi>Fore-Fathers</hi> were hardy and ſtrong, patient
of Toils and Fatigues: They cut their Way into Mountains of Stone, if any Place
of Strength were built on it, which they had Occaſion to beſiege. And as
they hew'd away that Part of the Rock which ſupported the Walls, they
underprop'd the Foundation with Wooden Pillars: And when they had finiſh'd
their <hi>Mine,</hi> they ſet Fire to certain Combuſtible Matter, which
conſuming theſe Supports, the Walls and Gates that reſted on them, ſunk
down, and left the Fortreſs naked and open to the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</p>
               <p>It had been well for the Inhabitants of <hi>Rezan,</hi> if their
City had been only thus gently diſmantl'd, by ſome Enemy againſt whom
they might have afterwards employ'd their Courage to defend themſelves, or
make<pb n="333" facs="tcp:104896:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>Compoſition. But poor Unfortunate People,
they have felt a ruder Shock, an unmerciful Blow of <hi>Fate,</hi> their City
being in a Minute's time, without the leaſt warning, ſtormed, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and laid in Heaps, by an Enemy which gives no Quarter.</p>
               <p>This Accident happen'd on the 15th. of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi>
about the Hour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lanamiſi.</hi> There were Five Hundred Barrels of
Powder in the <hi>Magazine;</hi> and the Force of the Blow was ſo violent,
that beſides the Deſtruction of that City or at leaſt the beſt Part of
it, all the Neighbouring Villages round about it, felt its Fatal Effect, ſome
of their Houſes ſhaking as in an Earthquake, others falling to Pieces.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly, <hi>Heaven</hi> is angry with theſe
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> and turns the very Inſtruments of their Defence and
Safety, into Scourges for their Chaſtiſement. I formerly ſent
<hi>Saleh</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent,</hi> an Account of the like
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that befel the City of <hi>Gravelines</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and of other terrible Effects of the Wrath of <hi>Heaven</hi> in the
<hi>Low-Countries.</hi> One Diſaſter follows cloſe on the back of
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; yet the <hi>Infidels</hi> are inſenſible and ſtupid, as they
were in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the <hi>Flood</hi> came and ſurpris'd
all the Inhabitants of the Country. That <hi>Prophet</hi> gave 'em warning of
the approaching Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He was Three whole Years in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down <hi>Indian
Plane-Trees,</hi> and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Planks, Beams, Pins and other
Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and Seven Year. more in Building<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104896:183"/>that
Wonderful <hi>Ship.</hi> The <hi>Infidels</hi> went by daily, and ſaw him at
Work, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided the Patient <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and taught their
Children to mock him, ſaying, <hi>Where is the Water this Ship is to ſail
in?</hi> After the <hi>Ark</hi> was finiſh'd, it lay on the Ground Seven
<hi>Moons,</hi> till they had Thrice ſacrific'd ſome of <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Followers to their <hi>Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was perfected in the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>Rajeb,</hi> and in

and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were ſhut up in the <hi>Ark,</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to burn
it to Aſhes. He call'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> with Scoffs,
ſaying, <hi>O</hi> Noah, <hi>where is the Water in which this Ship is to
ſail? It will be with you incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> replied the Holy Man,
<hi>before you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your Station. Come down, thou Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> ſaid
the proud <hi>Infidel, otherwiſe I will<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104896:183"/>burn thee and
thy Companions with Fire. O miſerable Man,</hi> ſaid <hi>Noah, Turn to</hi>
God, <hi>for his Judgments are ready to burſt forth on you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> Incens'd at this, commanded his
<hi>Slaves</hi> to put Fire to the <hi>Ark.</hi> But while he was yet
ſpeaking, he manifeſtly ſaw the Water guſhing out on all Hands round
about him, and under his Feet. Then his Heart was troubl'd, and full of
Anguiſh and Fear. He haſted to ſecure himſelf, with his
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> and Goods, in the Caſtles which he had built, on the
higheſt Mountains. But alas, the Earth open'd, and broke like a Spiders Web;
ſo violent was the Force of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which boyled up every where. The
Clouds pour'd down vaſt Chataracts of Rain, mix'd with Dreadful and
Inſupportable Thunder and Lightning. The Miſerable <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi>
throng'd upon one another, curſing and blaſpheming their <hi>Gods</hi> who
had deluded 'em. Great was the Confuſion and Cry every where; for ſuch a
Calamity had never been known ſince the <hi>Moon</hi> gave her Light. If any
were ſo nimble as to reach the Foot of a Mountain, yet he could not aſcend
by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Stones which fell on his Head, and Torrents of boyling Water
that ran down upon him, as if it had come out of a Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. And ſuppoſe
he had reach'd the top, it had been but a ſhort Delay of his Fate; for in a
word, the Waters ſwell'd Forty Cubits above the Higheſt Mountains, and all
the Living <hi>Generations</hi> periſh'd.</p>

Breath of Mortals, and by their ſubtile Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſoon diſſipate the

<hi>El-Samiel</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's time commit a Rape
upon the Lives of Travellers, ſcorching their Spirits up, and leaving on the

call'd at this time the <hi>Grand Infirmary</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> where
Baneful Sickneſs makes its Publick Reſidence. The timerous <hi>Giafers</hi>

and from theſe again to unfrequented Deſarts, Woods, and Heaths, carrying
their Wives and Children with 'em, and all the Subſtance of their Houſes.
The Roads are cover'd with the Caravans of doubtful Paſſengers, who dread
to think of going back, to the Contagious Seats they left behind, yet know not
where to be receiv'd anew. So general is the Conſternation, ſo ſtrong the
Fear of thoſe who yet ſurvive, leſt they ſhould alſo catch the
Infection and die.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, they have felt the ſtrokes of another
ſurprizing Calamity; <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Capital</hi> City of
<hi>England,</hi> being newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by Fire. It is not certain, whether
<hi>Deſign</hi> or <hi>Chance</hi> firſt kindled the devouring
<hi>Element.</hi> But it fell out at an unlucky Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104896:185"/>when the Wind was high, and from its Eaſtern Quarter, blew the
Flames full Weſt, which ſpreading North and South, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd all before
them, laying the greateſt Part of that Rich and Famous City in Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Some aſcribe this to a <hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>French;</hi>
others term it, a Judgment of <hi>God,</hi> for their Rebellion, Pride and
other crying Sins. Whilſt with equal Probability, a third Sort affirm, 'Twas

<hi>Maſons,</hi> who wanting Employment, and projecting the Method of

               </head>
               <p>I Am melancholy, beyond the Deſcription of <hi>Painters,
Poets,</hi> or the lively Eloquence of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Methinks, I'm ſome
Exotick <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> a perfect Foreigner on Earth; a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his Laws
and Maxims. I appear to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mortals like a <hi>Giafer</hi> or <hi>Frank</hi>
in his <hi>Weſtern</hi>-Dreſs at <hi>Morocco, Babilon,</hi> or
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> I mean not for my outward Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, (for in that I'm
Conformable enough to the <hi>Mode</hi> of the <hi>Region</hi> where I
reſide) but I'm all Unfaſhionable within; Ridiculous in my Sentiments and
Converſation. When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers laugh, I ſigh, and find a Reaſon to be ſad,
in the midſt of merry Company. Even Wine it ſelf that exhilarates all the
World beſide, does but encreaſe my Melancholy, by adding Strength unto my
labouring Thoughts. It ſublimates my Spirits up to Sacred Phrenſies. I am
all Lunatick at ſuch a Time. Each Glaſs creates new Dreams, more wild than
the ſtrange Flights and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a <hi>Santone.</hi> My heated Spleen,
like Mount <hi>Gibel,</hi> belches forth horrid Clouds of Smoak and Vapours,
which lay long ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in its ſpongy Caverns; theſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpread, and cover all the <hi>Horizon</hi> of my<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104896:187"/>
                  <hi>Soul,</hi> rendring it Dark and Gloomy, as the <hi>Cymmerian</hi>
Solitudes, or the more diſmal Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys bordering on the River <hi>Styx,</hi>
where ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Charon</hi> waits to Ferry o'er the <hi>Caravans</hi> of
trembling <hi>Ghoſts,</hi> and land 'em in <hi>Elyzium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! that thoſe <hi>Fables</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Poets</hi>
were but true! Or that I knew but ſomething certain of our <hi>Future
State!</hi> Whether the <hi>Soul</hi> ſurvives or no, when Death has ſtopt
the Circulation of our Blood? And what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of that <hi>Immortal
Subſtance,</hi> after its parting from the <hi>Body?</hi> Whether it paſs
by Tranſmigration into the <hi>Embryo</hi> of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animal, as

believe? Or if ſome other <hi>Magnet</hi> does attract its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and
hidden Sympathies of <hi>Nature</hi> teach it to form its ſelf a Vehicle or
Body of the Elements? Perhaps, ſome <hi>Souls</hi> unite with Air, whilſt
others mix with Water, Earth or purer Skies. This for its horrid Sins in Mortal
State, may be by the <hi>Eternal Nemeſis</hi> ſunk down into the Fatal
Caverns of Mount <hi>Aetna, Strombolo,</hi> or <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> there to
Incorporate with burning Rivers and Lakes of Sulphur and other Minerals, to
hear perpetually the frightful Cracking, Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and loud Thunders of
thoſe Infernal Vaults: to be without Intermiſſion annoy'd with the
Eternal Stench of melted Mines, whoſe poignant Vapours equally kill it and
revive it every moment, that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to an endleſs Circle of
Miſeries: To feel<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104896:187"/>the Excruciating Torments which no
Tongue can utter; whilſt the Inceſſant Rapid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Exalted
and moſt Violent Fires, with which it is embodyed by Decree of <hi>Fate,</hi>
rob it of the very Poſſibility of the leaſt eaſy Thought or quiet
Minute; and at the ſame time rack it with Infinite Tortures.</p>
               <p>Think not my Dear <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that it is
Impoſſible a Separate <hi>Spirit,</hi> can thus be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Pains.
There's no ſuch thing as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſave <hi>God</hi> who
made all <hi>Bodies,</hi> and therefore was before them. The <hi>Angels</hi>
themſelves are partly Corporeal; ſo are the Devils. Do not believe then
that Mortal Man, who is in a middle State between theſe Two, ſhall by
Dying, gain a Priviledge above the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Spirits</hi> in
<hi>Heaven.</hi> As ſoon as Death has diſlodg'd us from One <hi>Body;
Nature, Providence</hi> or <hi>Fate,</hi> provides us Another, according to our
Qualities, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Merits. We may as well by
<hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> become the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of a
flaming Sulphur-Mine, or at leaſt of ſome Part of it, as of a Horſe, an
Eagle, or a Dove: For ſuch, for ought we know, may be the Diſpoſition of
Divine Wiſdom, Juſtice and Omnipotence.</p>
               <p>By the very ſame Reaſon another <hi>Soul</hi> may be
tranſported to the Open, Happy Skies, where it may either range in
boundleſs, free, and ſerene Tracts of <hi>Bliſs;</hi> or be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchis'd
in the Corporations of the <hi>Stars,</hi> to dwell in <hi>Palaces</hi> of
<hi>Azure, Topazes,</hi> and <hi>Diamonds;</hi> to poſſeſs
<hi>Privinces</hi> more Rich<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104896:188"/>than in <hi>Peru</hi> or
<hi>Guinea,</hi> where the Ruſticks plow up Gold; more beautiful and
pleaſant, than the famous Fields of <hi>Theſſaly. God</hi> knows what
will become of us after our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: But the Ignorance of this one
Truth, occaſions all my Melancholy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death</hi> is not formidable of it ſelf, nor all the
dolorous Circumſtances that precede it: 'Tis only what comes after, raiſes
all my Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Were I to melt away in lingring Agues and Conſumptions; or to

               <p>Once in a Cold and Froſty Evening, as I was travelling o'er a

chilling Sleet, which fell upon me from the Clouds; my Spirits alſo tyr'd
with tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104896:188"/>Journeys, and my anxious Thoughts were
wholly taken up about a Reſting-Place that Night, and how to avoid the

on the Road, at length I chanc'd to think of the Untry'd and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Voyage I

<hi>Souls,</hi> or <hi>Laws</hi> of a <hi>Separate State?</hi> Let him declare
what Uſage we ſhall find in that Inviſible and Dark Receſs from Life:
He ſhall be then eſteemed more than <hi>Apollo,</hi> by the penſive
<hi>Mahmut.</hi> Not the old <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Oracle</hi> could receive greater

                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:104896:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>'Tis with Pleaſure I contemplate
the Face of the <hi>Infant</hi> Earth, before it was deform'd by the
unneceſſary Arts of the <hi>Carpenter, Smith</hi> and <hi>Maſon:</hi>
When Men had no other Houſes, ſave what they made themſelves, every one
for his Family, of the Branches and Boughs of trees, interwoven with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,
Reeds and Ivy; and cover'd thick with Leaves and Graſs to ſhelter them from
Wind, Hail, Rain, and other Injuries of Weather. Or perhaps ſome had found
out a Den or Cave in the Earth, or the Hollow of a Rock, for a Sanctuary in
ſuch Caſes, where they repos'd in perfect Tranquillity, without Fear of
Snares or Violence, without Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Robbers, or any Tragical
Surprize. They went out and in, ſlept and wak'd, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd and reſted in
ſafety and quiet. Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Envy and Injuſtice had not as yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Minds of Mortals. The Earth brought forth Corn, Herbage, and Fruits,
without the Husbandman's or Gard'ners Labour: All Places abounded with Plenty
of Innocent Refreſhments, and thoſe Primitive Inhabitants coveted no more.
The Cattle and Bees afforded them Milk and Honey, and the Fountain-Waters were
Generous as Wine. This <hi>Globe</hi> was a complete <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and
no miſtaken Zeal had taught Men Religiouſly to invade one anothers Rights,
and in a pious Fury to murder their Neighbours, in hopes of meriting
<hi>Heaven</hi> hereafter. There was no ſuch thing as Bigottry or
Superſtition to be ſound among any of Humane Race. The<pb n="349" facs="tcp:104896:190"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Natrue</hi> was in Univerſal Force: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man
purſu'd the Dictates of Reaſon, without hearkning after <hi>Religious
Sophiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Sacred Fables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when once the Lucre of Gold had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Men's Manners,
and they not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Riches and Sweets which they daily cropt from
the Surface of the Earth, had found a Way to deſcend into her Bowels, ſtung
with an Inſatiable Deſire of hidden Treaſures; then began Injuſtice,
Oppreſſion and Cruelty to take place. Men made En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures to
themſelves, and encompaſs'd a certain Portion of Land with Hedges, Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Pales, to Fence them from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of others; For the Guilt of
their own vicious Inclinations, fill'd them with Fears, and made them Jealous
of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They built themſelves ſtrong Holds, Fortreſſes,
Caſtles and Cities. And their Terrors encreaſing with their Criminal
Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, they perſwaded themſelves, that the very Elements
would prove their Enemies, if not paciſied by Bribes and Preſents. Hence
ſprung the firſt Invention of <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and
from theſe vain Panick Fears of Mortals, the <hi>Gods</hi> deriv'd their
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree. For one built a <hi>Temple</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> another to the
<hi>Moon,</hi> a third to <hi>Jupiter, Mars</hi> or the reſt of the
<hi>Planets.</hi> Some adord the <hi>Fire,</hi> others the <hi>Water</hi> or
<hi>Wind,</hi> Every one ſet up to himſelf ſuch a <hi>God</hi> as he
phanſied would be propitious to him. Thus Error being equally propagated 
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:104896:191"/>with Humane Nature, they created an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Rabble of
Imaginary <hi>Deities,</hi> paying to thoſe <hi>Idols,</hi> the Supreme and
Incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honours, due only to the <hi>Eternal Eſſence, Father</hi>
and <hi>Source</hi> of all things.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they liv'd in Intolerable Pride and Luxury, in
conſtant Wars and Strife, in Darkneſs, Ignorance and Confuſion. I ſpeak
of ſuch as dwelt in Cities, and were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated together by one common
Intereſt. For ſtill there remain'd ſome who obey'd the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Traditions</hi> of <hi>Primitive
Humanity.</hi> Theſe dwelt in Tents or other Moveable Habitations, as our
Countrymen the <hi>Arabs</hi> do at this Day, with the <hi>Tartars</hi> their
Brethren. They ſcorn'd to faſten themſelves to the Earth, by
poſſeſſing any Part of it in Propriety: Every Field and Wood, Hill and
Valley, River and Well, were with them in Common. They ſtraggled whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>This is the Life ſo emulated by me, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that at
leaſt, a Retirement from Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that I may breath out my laſt Hours in a
free Air, remote from the ſtifling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Contagion of Mortals. I long
to range at Liberty through unfrequented Paths of Deſart Ground, o'er wild,
unpoliſh'd Heaths, from thence inſenſibly to fall into ſome Venerable
Solitude, where the dry, moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Barks of Trees, in ſilent Characters
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Antiquity of the Place; and gentle Whiſpers of the Winds,
inſtruct the Methods of <hi>Platonick</hi> Love; inſpire ſtrange
Paſſions,<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104896:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>which we never felt before, and teach
us to converſe with <hi>Satyrs, Nymphs,</hi> and other harmleſs
<hi>Tenants</hi> of the <hi>Shades.</hi> How great is the Pleaſure to be thus
ſurpriz'd with ſome harmonious, warbling Stream, or Silent, ſoft, deep,
Chriſtial River? To ſpeak <hi>Incognito</hi> with <hi>Dryads,
Hamadryads,</hi> and the Sporting <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's;</hi> To lie diſſolv'd in
Looſe, yet Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Enjoyments on the Banks; to talk with <hi>Nature,</hi>
with <hi>Immortal Subſtances,</hi> and with <hi>Eternity</hi> it ſelf? Oh
<hi>God!</hi> Is not this raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>'Tis difficult to ſay, whether it would be Pleaſant or
Painful to return from theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Parades of the <hi>Soul,</hi> to our
Domeſtick Felicities, tho' even in a Rural Life, which I acknowledge to be
the Happieſt on Earth. Yet there to trace the Herds and Flocks, to walk
amidſt the High-grown Corn, and Graſs, to pluck the bearded Ears of Barley,
to let our Eyes rowl o'er the various Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Wind-blown Wheat and
Millet, our Noſes to ſuck the Fragrant Airs of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Thyme, Oranges
and Limons, with Innumerable Spices; our Ears to hear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Melody of
Birds, and every Senſe to be tranſported, ſnathh'd away and loſt in
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ecſtacies; muſt needs be rank'd among the Higheſt Kinds of
Earthly Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>But to deſcend from theſe Enjoyments, to the Meaneſt and
moſt Common Diverſions of a Country-Life; methinks there's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiarly charming in the very El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Situation of the Houſes; whether it
be<pb n="352" facs="tcp:104896:192"/>on the Brow of a Hill, or the Bottom of a Valley; in
the midſt of a Wood, or the Opening of a Heath; on the Side of a Road, or in
ſome obſcure Corner of the Country. 'Tis agreeable, when waking in the
Morning, to hear the Bleating of Sheep, Lowing of Oxen, Screaming, Quacking and
Crowing of Geeſe, Ducks, Cocks, and other Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Animals; to hear the
lowder Winds, threatning to tear up Trees by the Roots, demoliſh Houſes,
and remove the Globe it ſelf, if poſſible, from off its <hi>Baſis.</hi>
This would be better Muſick to me for a Change, than a Conſort of
<hi>Dulcimers, Theorbo's, Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels</hi> and <hi>Viols.</hi> Humane Nature
delights in Variety, and there is a certain Audacious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the
<hi>Soul,</hi> which loves to venture on Extreams. The Rain, the Dirt, the
Stink of Hogs, Camels, Dromedaries, and other neceſſary Rural Beaſts,
would pleaſe me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than the conſtant tedious Eaſe, and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Sweets of <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>City.</hi> I ſweat whilſt thus ſhut up
within theſe Walls: It cloys me to be daily walking in a Circle, to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
always o'er the ſame Ground, in a vaſt Labyrinth of Houſes, where my
Senſes meet no new refreſhing Objects, but my Ears are hourly nauſeated,
vex'd and tyr'd with Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Din of Coaches, Carts, Artificers, and the
harſh Voices of ſuch as ſell Fleſh, Fiſh, and other things about the
Streets. My Eyes can find no grateful Proſpects, but daſh'd with ſurly
rugged Looks of proud and wealthy <hi>Infidels;</hi> or with the fly Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104896:192"/>Smiles of well-ſhap'd People, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn me for my
Bandy-Legs, and Crooked Back.</p>
               <p>In a word, my dear <hi>Baſſa,</hi> I long to feel the gentle
Breezes of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> purifying my <hi>Soul</hi> and cleanſing it
from ſo many Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I languiſh for the Sight of <hi>Turbants</hi> and
<hi>Creſcents,</hi> for the devout Call of the <hi>Mue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins</hi> on the lofty
<hi>Minarets:</hi> I die in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Sacred <hi>Faſts</hi> and
<hi>Feaſts,</hi> the Nocturnal Joys of <hi>Ramezan,</hi> the Revels and
Chearful Illuminations of <hi>Beiram,</hi> and the Imperial <hi>Dunalma's.</hi>
When I think of theſe things, my <hi>Soul</hi> burſts forth in fervent
Invocations, and every Faculty crys <hi>Alla, Alla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Immortal One</hi> hear my
Prayers, and grant me the Happineſs to ſee the Face of Noble <hi>Kerker
Haſſan,</hi> in an <hi>Horizon</hi> pure and free from the Defilement of
<hi>Infidels.</hi>

               <head>LETTER XVIII. To <hi>Iſouf,</hi> his Kinſman a Merchant
at <hi>Aſtracan.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I ſent a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to thee in the Year 1664. wherein
among other things, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended our Couſin <hi>Solyman</hi> to thy
Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Patronage, if ever he ſhould travel to <hi>Aſtracan,</hi>
as I advis'd him. For thou know'ſt he has a Roaming <hi>Genius,</hi> without
the Wit to improve himſelf in any Foreign Country, unleſs he has a Friend
to guide and take care of him: And then 'twill be a difficult Task to make him
ſenſible, where he is. He'll always think he is within the Verge of the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Hunt, where he may domineer at large, under the
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Retainer to the <hi>Sultan.</hi> He's a ſtrange humour'd Fellow.
I know not what to make of him. He's as Changeable as <hi>Proteus,</hi> or a
<hi>Chamelion:</hi> Sometimes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly dull and Flegmatick, like a
<hi>Hadgi;</hi> at another Seaſon you ſhall fell his Pulſe beating to the
Tune of Youthful Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Luſt, and other Vices. To Day he'd be a
<hi>Dervich, Santone,</hi> or any thing that bears the Form of Holineſs: But
when he's ſlept upon't, the vain Young Convert would return again to the
World, and be a Soldier,<pb n="355" facs="tcp:104896:193"/>Courtier, Profeſſor of the
<hi>Law,</hi> or any Thing that makes a Figure in the Eyes of Men. So unwelcome
are the rigid Paths of Vertue, to a <hi>Soul</hi> not well eſtabliſh'd in
its <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet our Couſin <hi>Solyman,</hi> as I am told, is the
<hi>Muſſulman</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> as to his
<hi>Exteriour.</hi> With Hand devoutly laid to Breaſt, and humbleſt Couch
o'th' Head, he gives the <hi>Salem</hi> to his Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: Soft,
as the Signs of <hi>Mutes</hi> in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio:</hi> Humble, as the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Chapman, walking through the Streets, is forc'd to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
when he is hector'd by the Rampant <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Oh my Couſin <hi>Iſouf,</hi> 'tis Grief to ſay, that
<hi>Solyman,</hi> Partaker of our <hi>Blood,</hi> is Baſe, Ungrateful, and
Perfidious: That he ſhou'd be thus Unnatural, ſtudying the utmoſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of our Life; inſtead of Honeſt, Juſt, and Noble Preſents, to prolong
it.</p>
               <p>I had Reaſon, long ago, to compare him to <hi>Pontius
Pilate;</hi> and if I had gone on, and ſcum'd off all the moſt Enormous
Crimes of Humane Race, 'twould be too little to expreſs his Enmity againſt
<hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut,</hi> the kindeſt Uncle, and the trueſt Friend, that e'er poor
<hi>Solyman</hi> cou'd boaſt of.</p>
               <p>But he is Degenerate, and that's too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, without the
mournful Sighs of thee and me, to increaſe the Aggravation of his Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:104896:194"/>In Fine, he's our Kinſman, and let us
ſhew Mercy. He has been perfidious to me, and I wou'd retrench the Words I
have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Diſgrace. If he comes to <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> do as
thou pleaſeſt: But have an Eye over thine own Affairs. Take not
<hi>Solyman</hi> for an <hi>Angel..</hi> He is ſtill but a <hi>Turbant</hi>
maker; a Frolickſom Blade; and a Merchant that makes a very ſmall
Figure.</p>
               <p>Couſin <hi>Iſouf,</hi> forget not the <hi>Maxims</hi> thou
haſt learn'd in thy Travels: Be true to thy Friends, and thy ſelf. Honour
the Memory of thy deceaſed Parents. Love all Men, that are good. And be not
remiſs in praying for the <hi>Soul</hi> of thy deceaſed Uncle, whenever
<hi>God</hi> ſhall call for it.</p>
